**TypR a type system for R!**

TypR is a word game with Typescript (a superset of JavaScript) and the common way of naming things in the R community. The initial goal is to create a better experience with building packages for R. Indeed, TypR is not only a type checker but brings greater tools to build packages for data science in general and wants to be an easy way to convert research papers into code. TypR adds great static types and a flexible syntax with some cool tricks (metaprogramming) that make it great to work with.

**COMING SOON**

Associations are crucial for communities in areas such as sustainable development and leisure activities. However, they are often understaffed in terms of human resources. The goal of this project, which is a continuation of the 'digital transformation' course, is to create an app to encourage associative volunteering and facilitate potential matches between young people and Geneva-based associations using a digital platform.
