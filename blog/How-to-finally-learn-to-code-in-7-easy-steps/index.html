<h1>How to finally learn to code in 7 easy steps</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether you’re diving into your first programming language or adding another to your repertoire (let’s become polyglot!), there’s one thing many of us share: <em>the journey of learning to code on our own</em>. In today’s world, it seems easy to embark on this journey, given the plethora of resources at our fingertips. However, this abundance brings its own set of unique challenges.</p>
<p>Learning to code independently often leads to what is known as the famous “tutorial hell.” It’s a common trap where learners, in their quest for the perfect guide, find themselves circling in a maze of tutorials. This endless search makes every tutorial appear indecipherable. And even when the right tutorials are found, months can pass in study without the satisfying sense of real progress, leading to weariness and frustration.</p>
<p>Another significant hurdle is the ever-elusive ‘perfect time’ to learn. Many struggle to find or make time in their busy schedules to dedicate to coding, further prolonging their learning journey. If you need advice on that we have a nice blog post for you: <a href="https://wedata-active-blog.netlify.app/posts/two_minutes_rule/">“The two-minute rule for busy coder/learner”</a></p>
<p>But fear not! The following 7 steps are designed to help you navigate these challenges more smoothly and effectively, ensuring you won’t face the same obstacles that have hindered others. These steps are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Make a roadmap</strong>: Plan your learning journey.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the right resources</strong>: Select materials that suit your learning style.</li>
<li><strong>Take notes along the way</strong>: Documenting your progress aids in retention.</li>
<li><strong>Learn the basics thoroughly</strong>: Strong foundations are key.</li>
<li><strong>Engage in projects</strong>: Apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Revisit the basics</strong>: Regularly reinforce fundamental concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate</strong>: Learn from and with others.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rest of this article, we will dive deep into each of these steps, providing you with practical advice and insider tips to make your coding journey a successful and enjoyable one. So, let’s get started and turn those coding dreams into reality!</p>
</section>
<section id="help-i-dont-know-what-to-learn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="help-i-dont-know-what-to-learn">0. Help! I don’t know what to learn!</h2>
<p><em>Note: If you exactly know what you want to learn you can skip this part!</em></p>
<p>If you’re <strong>feeling overwhelmed</strong> about where to start your coding journey, you’re not alone. “What should I learn first?” is an increasingly common question, not just due to the vast array of options available, but also because of the ongoing ‘wars’ between different programming languages, each claiming to be the best. Navigating through these passionate and often subjective debates can be tricky. It can lead to <strong>two main issues</strong>: <strong>difficulty in making a choice</strong> (which breeds procrastination) or <strong>ending up with a language that doesn’t really suit your needs</strong>.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the classic debates like “The best programming language for…”, “Which JavaScript Framework to choose?”, or the famous “Python vs.&nbsp;R”. These discussions are recurrent and can be more confusing than helpful. So, how do you cut through the noise?</p>
<p>The simplest approach is to <strong>avoid starting your search on the Internet</strong>. Instead, <strong>make a list of your own needs and objectives</strong>. On the Internet, there’s a risk that others will decide for you, pitching a language as the be-all and end-all (though, thankfully, not everyone does this). Approaching with a clear idea of what you want to achieve helps limit undue influence and indecision.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>consider the support and resources available around you</strong> (friends, colleagues or books) and align them with your personal or professional plans. <strong>If you’re still in doubt, it’s okay to pick an option at random or go with a ‘default’ choice</strong>. Don’t linger too long in this phase of decision-making. Remember, you can always pivot to another language later – no learning is ever wasted.</p>
<p>The beauty of programming is that the <strong>core concepts are often transferable between languages</strong>. Different programming languages are just tools – it’s how you use them that matters. For example, if you start with Python due to its simplicity and later decide to switch to Java, you’ll find that many concepts like loops, variables, and data structures are similar, just with different syntax.</p>
<section id="but-who-to-talk-to" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-who-to-talk-to">But who to talk to?</h3>
<p>It’s a legitimate question - as a beginner, we don’t necessarily know how to translate our needs into clear, domain-specific objectives. Before going on the Internet, it’s always wiser to <strong>talk it over with a more advanced acquaintance</strong>. Now, in the age of artificial intelligence, an in-depth <strong>discussion with a model like ChatGPT can be enlightening</strong> (but becareful it might be biased!).</p>
<p>In summary, step zero is about <strong>making an informed, yet not overthought, decision</strong>. Choose a language or a technology based on your current needs, availability of resources, and your future goals. And remember, the journey of coding is flexible – it’s perfectly fine to change paths as you grow and discover more about your interests and the tech world.</p>

</section>
<section id="make-a-roadmap" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-a-roadmap">1. Make a roadmap</h2>
<p>The journey of learning to code is akin to embarking on a voyage – having a roadmap is crucial. The path of least resistance often leads to joining online curricula or courses on platforms like [Coursera](<a href="https://www.coursera.org/," class="uri">https://www.coursera.org/,</a> <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. While these courses are beneficial and circumvent the need to design your own program, they are, by nature, very standardized. They may not align perfectly with your objectives or your preferred learning style.</p>
<p>If you find that these courses don’t meet your unique needs, crafting your own roadmap is a viable alternative. It’s tempting to dive straight into tutorials and start coding, but this approach can often lead to confusion and discouragement. <strong>The key is to have a clear goal</strong>. You should be able to answer questions like, “Why do I want to learn this programming language?” or “What do I specifically want to create with it?” Remember, a programming language can serve many purposes – from developing websites (like HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development) to creating data analysis tools (such as Python for data science).</p>
<p>Once you’ve defined your objective, the next step is to <strong>break it down into smaller, achievable, and measurable goals</strong>. For instance, if your aim is to build a website, start by learning basic HTML and CSS. Then, gradually progress to more complex tasks like JavaScript and back-end development.</p>
<p>With these smaller goals in mind, <strong>order them and compile them into a learning roadmap</strong>. The more personalized your roadmap, the better. However, it’s essential to <strong>start with the basics</strong> regardless of your ultimate goal. At this stage, your roadmap doesn’t have to be incredibly detailed, but you should at least know what skills you need to acquire at each stage.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t underestimate the importance of this planning phase</strong>. Dedicate <strong>a good amount of time</strong> to it – <strong>up to two weeks</strong>, if necessary. During this period, don’t hesitate to seek advice from more advanced individuals or even artificial intelligence platforms. Compare your plan with roadmaps recommended by others to ensure you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>Remember, your roadmap is not set in stone. It should be a living document that evolves as you gain more knowledge and understanding of the subject. You can’t know everything from the outset, and it’s perfectly fine to adapt your plan as you progress. <strong>Especially when it comes to projects (see “6. Engage in projects”)</strong>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a well-thought-out roadmap tailored to your specific goals and learning style is an invaluable tool in your journey to learn coding. It provides direction, keeps you focused, and helps measure your progress, setting you up for a successful and fulfilling learning experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="choose-the-right-resources" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choose-the-right-resources">2. Choose the right resources</h2>
<p>Selecting the right resources is a crucial step in making your roadmap more tangible. It’s not necessary to have resources for every step right away; you can discover new resources as you progress. The key is not to get bogged down in finding the ‘best’ resources, as this can be a laborious and often futile task. Focus on finding resources that best suit your learning style.</p>
<p>To help you with this, ask yourself some guiding questions: - <strong>“Am I willing to spend money to learn?”</strong> - <strong>“Do I prefer paper or digital resources?”</strong> - <strong>“Do I prefer static or interactive resources?”</strong></p>
<p>For each of these combinations, there are corresponding resource types: - If you’re open to spending money and prefer paper resources, consider investing in <strong>comprehensive coding books</strong>. - If you prefer digital and are willing to invest, <strong>paid online courses</strong> on platforms like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> offer structured learning paths. - For those who prefer free resources, there’s a wealth of <strong>YouTube tutorials</strong> and <strong>online documentation</strong>. - If interactive learning is your style, platforms like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a> offer hands-on coding exercises.</p>
<p>For more interactive learning ressources (exercices) I wrote a blog post here: <a href="https://wedata-active-blog.netlify.app/posts/programming_exercise_websites/">“Free programming exercice website”</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that preferences might change based on your experience level. For example, if you’re learning your second programming language, you might find more advanced resources like <strong>technical blogs or community forums</strong> more beneficial.</p>
<p>However, each type of resource has its shortcomings. Books can become outdated, online courses might not cover the latest technologies, and videos can sometimes lack depth. Don’t hesitate to ask for recommendations from experienced coders or online communities for a list of useful resources.</p>
<p>A great way to start strong is by taking a <strong>crash course (written or video) of maximum 2 hours</strong>, and coding along with it. This approach helps you quickly grasp the syntax and philosophy of the language. Remember, it’s crucial to <strong>practice actively</strong> and not just passively follow along with the theory. For more advanced programmer with a good understanding of programming concepts reaching their new programming language a website like <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">“learning x in y minutes”</a> might be a good ressource.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there’s no such thing as a perfect resource. It’s okay to change your resources as you progress. The most important thing is to work hard and stick with it for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Now that the beginning of your roadmap is set, you’re ready to embark on your coding journey with confidence. Remember, the journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single keystroke!</p>
</section>
<section id="take-notes-along-the-way" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-notes-along-the-way">3. Take notes along the way</h2>
<section id="take-notes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-notes">Take notes</h3>
<p>This section emphasizes a good practice crucial for avoiding stagnation and deviation in your coding journey: <strong>taking notes throughout the learning process</strong>. While some programming languages like Julia have exceptional documentation, others like Python boast a plethora of tutorials by individuals. Then there are languages with more challenging documentation, such as Haskell or Nim. But ultimately, the best documentation is the one you create for yourself.</p>
<p>This can take the form of personalized notes in a style that suits you best, be it a text document, a Word file, or a Markdown file. Another vital type of documentation is the <strong>code you write yourself</strong>. Ensure it’s clean and well-commented (but not excessively so). This code becomes a valuable resource when you need an example later. Additionally, <strong>organize your code and folders</strong> effectively to easily navigate your work.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-help" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-help">Finding help</h3>
<p>When it comes to seeking help, <strong>autonomy should always be your first approach</strong>. This means trying to solve problems on your own by testing and researching, sometimes for hours, before seeking external assistance. Remember, making mistakes is a fundamental part of learning. Relying too heavily on others for answers – whether it’s a more experienced colleague or the internet – deprives you of the crucial problem-solving experience at the heart of programming.</p>
<p>The risk with relying on artificial intelligence for help is that it can provide answers without limit, which can lead to a dependency on external solutions. Without honing your problem-solving skills, your learning becomes slower and less effective, leaving you reliant on others or tools for coding. Strive for <strong>independence</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-best-practices-and-tricks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-best-practices-and-tricks">Learning best practices and tricks</h3>
<p>It’s also important to learn the best practices and tricks of the language you’re studying. The beauty of these tips is that they can be learned at different stages of your journey. However, the sooner you incorporate them, the more quickly you’ll boost your productivity. Embracing these best practices early on is always beneficial.</p>
<p>In summary, keep detailed notes, stay organized, seek autonomy in problem-solving, and continuously learn best practices and tricks in your chosen programming language. These steps are fundamental in developing a strong foundation in coding, leading you towards becoming a proficient and independent coder.</p>

<section id="learn-the-basics-thoroughly" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learn-the-basics-thoroughly">4. Learn the basics thoroughly</h2>
<p>The foundation of understanding any programming language lies in mastering its basics, which is why it’s a crucial first step in your roadmap. However, learning the basics isn’t just about grasping the syntax; it’s equally important to understand the philosophy behind the language. The best way to solidify your understanding of these basics is through practice exercises, underscoring the importance of choosing the right resources.</p>
<section id="universal-concepts-in-programming-languages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="universal-concepts-in-programming-languages">Universal concepts in programming languages</h3>
<p>There are several universal concepts common to all programming languages that you need to ensure you master:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Variable declaration</strong>: Understanding how to create and use variables.</li>
<li><strong>Data types</strong>: Familiarity with different types of data (e.g., integers, strings).</li>
<li><strong>Control structures</strong>: Knowledge of if-else statements, loops, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Functions/methods</strong>: Creating and utilizing reusable blocks of code.</li>
<li><strong>Input/output operations</strong>: Handling user input and system output.</li>
<li><strong>Error handling</strong>: Managing and responding to errors in code.</li>
<li><strong>Basic data structures</strong>: Using arrays, lists, and dictionaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>As data scientists or statisticians, we have the impression that these concepts are not important to us as long as we don’t code as a programmer (we can use R without knowing how to program, for example), but this deprives us of essential knowledge that will help us in our learning process (in particular, understanding and resolving errors).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engage-in-projects">5. Engage in projects</h2>
<p>Projects are arguably the most effective way to learn programming. They encompass an array of steps, reflections, and errors, making them instrumental in understanding and applying the various tools and concepts you’ve learned. Projects make the abstract concepts tangible and help you start learning autonomously. If you haven’t already included projects in your roadmap, it’s time to do so. Projects will not only enhance your learning but also serve as benchmarks for self-evaluation.</p>
<section id="how-to-choose-your-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-choose-your-project">How to choose your project</h3>
<p>Initially, <strong>choose a very guided project</strong>, preferably one accompanied by a video or tutorial that leads you step-by-step. This will help you understand the project flow and the intricacies involved. After completing a guided project, move on to <strong>less structured projects</strong>. If you struggle to find suitable projects for your programming language, seek inspiration from the internet or ask someone experienced to help you select. Don’t hesitate to look at projects in other programming languages for ideas.</p>
<p>For subsequent projects, consider <strong>working on something personal and meaningful</strong> to you. This approach keeps motivation high and makes the learning process more enjoyable.</p>

<section id="revisit-the-basics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revisit-the-basics">6. Revisit the basics</h2>
<p>Even as you progress and become more adept at your chosen programming language, it’s crucial to <strong>regularly revisit the basics</strong>. With the experience you’ve accumulated, your understanding of fundamental concepts will deepen, and you’ll often gain new insights. This revisiting is not only a refresher but also a means of reinforcing and solidifying your skills.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the most effective ways to strengthen your grasp of the basics is to <strong>teach or help others</strong>. Once you’ve completed your first project, you should be at a level where you can offer valuable advice to beginners. The power of teaching lies in transforming your practical, personal knowledge into accessible and comprehensible information for those who are just starting out. This process not only hones your pedagogical skills but also compels you to develop a clearer understanding of fundamental principles. You’ll frequently find yourself answering the daunting “Why?” question, which in turn deepens your own comprehension.</p>
<p>Additionally, teaching requires you to discern what is essential to convey, further clarifying your understanding of the basics. Engaging in <strong>online or in-person groups</strong> where you can teach or assist others is highly beneficial. It not only enhances your own skills but also contributes positively to the learning journey of many others.</p>
<p>If teaching directly isn’t your preference, consider creating <strong>written or video resources</strong> to share your knowledge. Documenting your learning process and explaining concepts in your own words can be just as enlightening.</p>
<p><strong>And if you don’t think you have what it takes, don’t underestimate yourself! You certainly do!</strong></p>
<p>In summary, revisiting and reinforcing the basics is a crucial step in your coding journey. Whether through teaching others, creating resources, or simply reviewing concepts on your own, this practice ensures a solid and continually evolving understanding of your programming language.</p>
