🚀 Big News!

We are excited to announce the release of a new version of our programming language TypR — a typed version of R. This release marks an important milestone toward a more reliable ecosystem tailored to the needs of modern data science and software engineering teams.

## Our mission

- Bring the full power of R for statistical analysis and data science, while adding a robust type system.
- Improve code safety, readability, and project maintainability.
- Make collaboration easier by reducing errors caused by data conversions and inconsistencies.

We truly believe this evolution can transform the way developers and data scientists work with R together.
