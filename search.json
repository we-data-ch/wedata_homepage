    "section": "",
    "text": "For busy readers\n\n\n\n\nWe generally have time on our hands, but what makes us feel short of time is the prioritization of our activities.\nStarting to code is difficult, so the activity will be low on our priority list.\nTo make it easier to get started, you need to start with 2-5 minute sessions every week and gradually increase the importance of the activity.\nTo find out how to put this into practice and discover other tips, read the blog post.\n\n\n\nHey, aspiring coders! Let’s dive deeper into making coding a seamless part of your busy life. If you’re struggling to find time, the two-minute rule is your new best friend. It’s all about setting yourself up for success with quick, easy-to-start tasks. Let’s expand on this and give you some real actionable steps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you read this article, please take note so that you do not need to come back too often. And be sure to apply everything right away!😁\n\n\n\n\nThe Two-Minute Rule is pretty straightforward: If a habit is hard to get into because of a lack of time, try to start slowly with short 2-minute sessions. This principle, a fusion of the Atomic habits philosophy and the Kaizen method, is perfect for building a coding habit. It’s about overcoming the inertia of starting by making the first step super easy. It is a practice that emphasizes continuous improvement through small, incremental changes in habits while getting rid of bad habits (which is not the focus today).\nIn concrete terms, you start by forging a habit by being regular for a small period of time, in our case 2 minutes every week. Then, when the habit is acquired, you can start to increase the duration and frequency according to what suits you best. You can start with 5 or 10 minutes if that’s not too much of a challenge.But don’t be greedy and hasty at first!\nIndeed we are looking for long term results. Of course, nothing restrain you to have non-regular coding period outside of your new habit, but keep the regularity with this specific habit!\nHow to apply that in your coding habit? Follow this steps:\n\nSet clear objectives: Making a roadmap is event better! There are lots of different things to learn in coding. Not everything is necessary, and that’s why it’s important to set concrete, practical objectives. For example:\n\nFor Python it might be “Know how to create a complete machine learning workflow” rather than “Know how to do machine learning”.\nFor R it might be “Apply a Bayesian multilevel model in a research project on wage inequality” rather than “Know how to use Bayesian statistics”.\n\nDivide this/these objective(s) in multiple smaller steps: To avoid being overwhelmed by a huge goal, you need to break it down into smaller, chronological and measurable objectives. If you’re having trouble doing this, there are plenty of roadmap infographics on the Internet, and in the worst case, ask Chat-GPT or another model to do it for you. Going back to the previous examples:\n\nFor Python it could be:\n\n“Import data”\n“Clean data”\n…\n“Apply random forest model”\n“Compare performance of different models”\n“Make predictions”\n“Export model”…\n\nFor R it could be:\n\n“Select appropriate data”\n“Collect data”\n…\n“Perform descriptive analysis”\n“Specify appropriate priors”\n“Optimize the model”\n“Create regression tables”…\n\n\nSet a precise time: To anchor a good habit, it’s important to rely on regularity rather than effort. Start by setting a simple rhythm (in this case, 2 minutes) and, above all, a precise context. For example: “Every Friday at 6 p.m. on my table in my room, I’m going to learn to code, for 2 minutes”. You can increase the length and frequency of these sessions as you get used to them. There’s no point in starting intensively - it’s the regularity that counts.\nIdentify obstacles and set up a coding zone: See the next section for more details!\n\n\n\n\nThink about what stops you from coding. Here are some classical examples:\n\nDistraction in your PC/smartphone?\nIs it setting up your environment?\nFinding the right resources?\nLack of roadmap or precise steps?\nStarting take too much time (more than 2 minutes)?\nForgetting everything each time?\nNon regularity?\n\nWrite these down and tackle them!\nThe best way to resolve most of the problems is to create an environment that invites you to code and get started fast. Here’s how:\n\nEliminate distractions: Turn off non-essential notifications and put your smartphone aside. You have little time to focus on your work, don’t waste it!\nDedicated space: Even if it’s just a corner of your desk, make it your “coding zone.”\n\nProjects: On your computer, use projects which are dedicated environement (generally a folder) in which you find all the scripts and tools you need to start coding. For instance, Rstudio and VS code have their dedicated way to organise project.\nKeep things tidy: Spend time organizing your projects and your code in a clean way. Every minute you spend getting your project clean will be hours of work you’ll save yourself in the future. What’s more, your project will become a great example for your future works, and therefore a golden resource!\n\nKeep your tools handy: Have your laptop, charger, and any books or resources you need within reach.\n\nBookmark resources: Keep tabs open with coding websites or tutorials you’re following to check anything you need. Ai tools are also ressources, but limit their use (you risk becoming dependent and learning nothing).\nTake notes as you learn: The best ressources are the one you make. Keep a file open (Markdown, Word document, etc.) to note everything useful to help you remember tips/tricks and to write down steps to get started fast (you rarely can remember everything the first time).\nLook for productivity tools: Many code editor like RStudio or VS Code have powerfull extensions. I highly recommand TODO extensions on both RStudio and VS Code, since they let you start right away with specific tasks on your code and help you navigate them.\n\nLook for accountability: It’s no easy task to forge a new habit and stick to it. Often it’s events beyond our control that prevent us from sticking to them. That’s why it’s important to think ahead, to make it difficult to get out of these habits and easy to get in. The most important thing is not to blame ourselves, but to get back into the swing of things as soon as possible:\n\nPlan B: Not only do you need to choose a good time that won’t be disrupted, but you also need to anticipate how you can make up for any unforeseen circumstances. You need to plan ahead for a Plan B, which is another time when the session can be rescheduled. It’s not enough to “make up the time” at the next session; what counts is regularity, not time spent.\nPlan C: There are extreme cases where it’s literally impossible to continue the activity as desired. In such cases, coding is no longer possible (prolonged absence, lost computer, broken hand, etc.). If possible, you need to plan ahead for a viable alternative to keep up the pace. This doesn’t necessarily mean coding. The following section gives a list of things you can do.\nWorking with colleagues: The best way to stay accountable without putting too much blame or pressure on yourself is to join a work group that has set itself a goal of regularity (it doesn’t have to be the same subject). For example, you can organize regular face-to-face or online meetings. During these meetings, everyone works on their personal project. Or you can simply share your progress without the need for meetings. Whatever suits you!\n\n\nAll of the above may seem like big challenges, especially if you’re not familiar with them. But don’t worry, you don’t have to apply them all at once. I’ve arranged them in order of importance. Concentrate on one element at a time until it becomes natural for you. Then you can concentrate on the next element. Since eliminating distractions and finding a dedicated place to work are required, you can start with setting up your project, then move on to keeping your work area clean, then move on to making resources available, and so on. See? A piece of cake!\n\n\n\nOk, we have everyting to start. So what now? What can you possibly do in two, five our ten minutes? Also what about the extrem cases when we can’t possibly code? Let’s break down some coding activities:\n\nNote: activities that can be done whith a smartphone are marked with a (📱) and activities tha can be done without coding are marked with a (✅). Also, when no technology is needed it is marked with a (✏️).\n\n\nTwo- or five-minute tasks:\n\nDo an online coding exercise (here is a list of good platforms) 📱\nRead a tutorial/documentation/book and take note 📱✅✏️\nDrill a simple script to memorize it\nSet up a working directory in the computer✅\nOrganise a project in smaller steps✅\nWrite a comment/TODO in the code explaining your next steps.\nRead a code snippet and type it out.\nBookmark a tutorial for your next session. 📱✅\nSet new goals✅✏️\n\nTen- or five-minute tasks:\n\nAll the previous tasks\nStart a new project (divided in multiple sessions)\nTry a new library/package\nDebug code or find solutions on internet\nFollow a short YouTube tutorial (it is better to code in the same time) 📱✅\nOrganise/clean the project ✅\n\nThirty-Minute or more tasks:\n\nAll the previous tasks\nBuild a small project\nWork through longer tutorials (you should definitely code along)\nLearn new coding tricks 📱\nLearn other coding tools (GitHub for instance)\nLearn new languages (latex, regex, html, etc.)\n\nWhen coding is impossible:\n\nOrganize your roadmap 📱✅✏️\nDiscuss about programming 📱✅✏️\nCompile new resources 📱✅✏️\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve finished the main part of the tutorial, so you can stop here. If you’re still not sure how to get started, in the next section we present a concrete example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore you move on, choose a two-minute task from this list and do it. Right now (or plan it for later). It’s all about building momentum!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have everything we need to start these new habits. Let’s take the example of Sandiya, a geographer who wants to learn how to use R for a future article. The problem is that she knows nothing about R. So she decides to use the two-minute principle.\n\n\nOnce upon a time in the bustling city, there was a geographer named Sandiya. Passionate about urbanism, she had a dream: to create a detailed map of urban car density using geodata from parking places. But there was a catch – she didn’t know R, the programming language perfect for this task.\nStep 1: Defining the goal\nSandiya’s project was clear: analyze car density variability in various parking places over time. But to do this, she needed to learn R, master data analysis, understand web scraping, and get a grip on geospatial analysis.\nStep 2: Crafting a roadmap\nAfter fruitful discussions and online research, Sandiya outlined her learning path:\n\nBasics of R\nData Analysis Skills\nWeb Scraping Knowledge\nGeospatial Analysis with R\n\nWith her roadmap in hand, she decided to start small, applying the Two-Minute Rule.\nStep 3: Setting the habit\nEvery Tuesday at 4 pm, Sandiya’s living room transformed into her learning zone. She started with just two minutes of R practice and gradually increased her time.\nStep 4: The initial strides\nIn her first session, Sandiya installed R and RStudio, a small but crucial step. The following week, she began online exercises on W3Schools, steadily progressing through them. It was a wise choice, since the website is completly free, doesn’t require an account and has tutorials on R.\nStep 5: Expanding the learning schedule\nTwo months in, Sandiya was already diving into “R for Data Science” (a free online book to learn R). She added Thursdays at 4 pm to her schedule, now feeling more confident and eager to learn. She was already working 30 minutes per session.\nStep 6: Gaining confidence\nAfter another two months, she had honed her data analysis skills. Tackling a data analysis tutorial, she replicated the examples, cementing her understanding.\nStep 7: Diving into web scraping\nSandiya then turned to YouTube videos and blog posts to learn web scraping. She meticulously took notes, starting to collect her needed data. She needed more time, so she decided to work at least one hour per session.\nStep 8: Embracing geospatial analysis\nSimultaneously, she delved into a Bookdown on geospatial analysis in R, replicating examples and building her skills.\nStep 9: Six months of transformation\nSix months from her humble two-minute beginnings, Sandiya was working six hours weekly on R (three hours each on Tuesday and Thursday) and had reached an advanced level. She was able to submit her paper for publication.\nStep 10: Flexibility and persistence\nNot every week was perfect. Sometimes, life intervened, and Sandiya rescheduled her Tuesday sessions to Saturday mornings. But she persisted.\nStep 11: Eyeing a new challenge\nNow, comfortably adept at R and with a regular habit firmly in place, Sandiya began contemplating learning Python, using the same effective, gradual method.\nSandiya’s story is a testament to the power of small, consistent steps. Starting with just two minutes of focused time, she transformed her skill set and realized her dream. Her journey, marked by clear goals, a structured roadmap, and adaptable persistence, is an inspiring blueprint for anyone looking to embark on a similar path. Remember, every big accomplishment starts with one small step. Just like Sandiya, you too can achieve your learning goals, one small, focused session at a time. 🌟💻🗺️\n\nRemember, coding doesn’t have to be a daunting time-sink. With the Two-Minute Rule, you’re not just learning to code; you’re integrating it into your life in manageable, enjoyable pieces. Keep it up, and watch how these minutes add up to significant progress. Happy coding, friends! 🚀💻✨"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, we’re diving into a rather controversial topic: ‘My problem with Python.’ But before you raise your eyebrows, let me clarify: It’s not quite what you think. So, let’s unravel this Python conundrum.\n\n\n\nLet’s start by setting the record straight. Python, the language, is pretty fantastic. It’s versatile, boasts a treasure trove of data science libraries, and guess what? It was my first programming language. That’s right, Python and I go way back to my days as a stats newbie, looking for something more robust than STATA.\nBack then, it was a showdown between R and Python for me. The online world seemed to be in a Python frenzy. Everywhere I looked, articles, tutorials, you name it – they all seemed to be chanting ‘Python, Python, Python!’ So, naturally, I jumped on the bandwagon. Python became my go-to for data science, my knight in shining armor, if you will.\n\n\n\nBut then, plot twist! During my master’s, I was forced to learn R. And guess what? I was blown away. R was like this hidden gem, perfectly cut for data analysis. Slowly but surely, R started replacing Python in my data science toolkit. That got me thinking: Were those Python-preaching articles a bit too… biased?\nAs I dug deeper, it became clear. Many of those Python articles had misunderstood R, or worse, underestimated it. The craziest thing about all this is that many of these articles have literally pointed out things that aren’t true, such as the fact that R doesn’t have any good machine learning or visualization libraries. Also, some were comparing plain R with Python + Pandas + Numpy + ScikitLearn + TensorFlow. This realization hit me hard.\nThese articles and videos were much more subjective than they seemed in their choice of examples (sometimes these examples were already out of date) and concretely little effort was made in searching in R.\nLatter I ventured further, exploring languages like Julia and Nim. I needed performance, I craved compilation, and I was hunting for application. These new languages opened my eyes to a world beyond Python. Yet, Python remained in my arsenal, like an old friend you can’t let go of.\n\n\n\nLike all programming languages, Python has its shortcomings, which I can easily mention. These flaws become obvious when I compare it to other programming languages I use: - It’s slow (not compiled) - Has a huge dependency on C for heavy tasks - Possible to create desktop applications, but inappropriate - Has no built-in linear algebra functionality - No integrated dataframe management functionality - No integrated statistics or machine learning functionality - Object-oriented doesn’t integrate well with any of the above functionalities (Numpy and Pandas for instance feel weird to use personally)\nAnd the list goes on. But these aren’t my problem: no programming language is perfect.\nSo, here’s my ‘problem’ with Python: It’s not the language itself, but the popularity bias surrounding it. This bias blinds us, leading many to overlook alternatives that might be better suited for certain tasks. It creates a bubble, where Python is the be-all and end-all, and other languages are mere afterthoughts. This bubble isn’t just limiting; it’s dangerous for beginners.\nIn concrete terms, thanks to its versatility, Python can become a comfort zone from which it’s hard to escape. But focusing on just one language and ignoring the alternatives can lead to a number of problems: - Performance: In the case of languages like Python, performance is limited and you have to rely on libraries that depend on other, more powerful languages for specific uses (C/C++). What’s more, when it comes to writing high-performance programs in their own right, it’s a bad idea to write them in Python or other supposedly faster alternatives (Pypy or Cython) when you could be using other more powerful and almost equally easy-to-use languages like Julia, Mojo or Nim. This solve the two language problem in a better way. - Ecosystem: Even if Python could virtually be used in many circumstances, there are languages that have ecosystems better suited to certain tasks, such as JavaScript for Web development, R for statistics, Kotlin for application development or Rust for system development. - Career: It’s possible to make a career out of a single programming language. The chances of working with just one language seem high in a rare programming language. In the case of a language like Python (which everyone uses), it’s more appropriate to have another language to back up your skills. Even in a field like data science, it’s very often required to know how to use SQL or R in addition to Python. What’s more, it’s not only machine learning skills that are required, but also knowledge of statistics, architecture (AWS, Azure, etc.) and other skills. What’s more, having more than one language means more career opportunities.\nDon’t get me wrong, Python is great. I still use it for many projects (nice for scripting). But the key takeaway? Don’t get cloistered in a single language. Explore, experiment, and most importantly, keep an open mind. Each language has its strengths, its charm, and yes, its quirks.\nSo, whether you’re a Python pro, an R enthusiast, or a Julia fan, remember: the world of programming is vast and varied. Embrace it. And hey, who knows? You might just find your new programming soulmate.\n\n\n\nSo, we’ve talked about the language, its strengths, and the bias around it. Now, let’s explore the darker side of popularity bias and the hit-parade effect in programming.\nYou see, popularity bias isn’t unique to Python or even programming. It’s a widespread phenomenon, where popularity feeds more popularity, often overshadowing other equally or more deserving options. In music, it’s the hit-parade effect – the more a song is played, the more popular it becomes, regardless of its quality.\nThis hit-parade effect seeps into the world of programming too. Python, no doubt a great language, has benefitted from this. Its popularity has skyrocketed, not solely because of its merits but partly due to a self-perpetuating cycle of popularity. It’s like a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger and bigger.\nBut why is this dangerous? Well, think about it. When one language dominates the spotlight, others are left in the shadows, no matter how good they might be. This creates a monoculture in programming, where diversity of thought, approach, and solution is stifled. We start seeing every problem as a nail, and Python as the only hammer we have.\nThis is less a problem for large companies using several programming languages, but rather for programmers engaged in a war to find the best programming language, or simply looking for the easy way out.\nBut let’s not get it twisted. Python is a fantastic language and a safe choice. Its simplicity, vast libraries, and community support are unparalleled. It’s like the friendly neighborhood of programming languages – welcoming and accessible (take notes Nim). But, part of its overwhelming popularity is definitely fueled by this hit-parade effect: It’s taught everywhere (even compulsary), and it’s virtually impossible not to have heard of it.\nPython is pushed by companies, articles, tutorials, over-enthusiastic Pythonistas, hype for Artificial Intelligence and yes, even content like this one. The danger lies in becoming so enamored with Python that we become blind to other languages’ potential. Remember, every language was designed with a purpose in mind, and sometimes, that purpose aligns perfectly with your specific needs.\nLike JavaScript, Python represents the piano in music; everyone knows how to play it in addition to their instrument of choice. But in the end, an orchestra is made up of a diversity of instruments, and without this diversity, there could be no beautiful symphony.\nSo, here’s my call to action: Explore. Be curious. Don’t let popularity bias dictate your choice of programming language. Dive into R for statistical analysis, Julia for high-performance computing, or even Rust for systems programming. The landscape is rich and diverse – a treasure trove waiting to be explored.\nIn the end, it’s about using the right tool for the job, not the most popular one. It’s about innovation, exploration, and sometimes, about going against the grain. So, whether you’re a seasoned coder or a newbie, remember: there’s a whole world beyond Python, and it’s just waiting for you to discover it.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s tackle the age-old debate: R versus Python. It’s a question as old as time in the data science world. Which one should you choose?\nWhen someone asks me, “Should I go for R or Python?” I don’t just throw an answer at them. Instead, I turn into a bit of a detective. I ask questions about their needs, motivations, and the environment they’re working in. Who around them is using these languages? What kind of analysis/code are they dealing with? What’s their end goal?\nYou see, it’s not about which language is “the best”. It’s about which language is better for you, for your specific situation. Python, with its simplicity and vast libraries, might be the go-to for general-purpose programming and machine learning. R, on the other hand, shines in statistical analysis and has fantastic packages for data visualization.\n\n\nBut here’s the kicker: I always suggest learning both (not at the same time of course). That’s right. Why limit yourself to one when you can have the best of both worlds? That’s what I wish someone had told me back in the day. Ask “Which one should I learn first?” not “Which one is the best?” And base your decision on your needs, not on a false competition filled with bias and misinformation. It’s easier to choose when you don’t feel that the choice you’ve made will impact your whole life. Knowing that you can learn the one you want next based on your needs is liberating.\nBeing a programming polyglot opens up a world of possibilities. It’s like being a chef with access to a global pantry of ingredients. You can pick and choose the best tool for each recipe, for each task at hand. And when you’re ready, why stop at R and Python? Dive into Julia for high-performance tasks, or explore SQL for database management. The more languages you know, the more versatile and capable you become.\nSo, dear listeners, embrace the journey of learning. Be open to expanding your skillset. Remember, in the rapidly evolving world of programming, being adaptable and versatile is key. And most importantly, never stop being curious. Who knows what incredible solutions you’ll discover when you step out of your comfort zone?\n\n\n\nI would like to offer some insights for Python enthusiasts who might not fully appreciate the capabilities of R. My observations suggest that there’s a prevalent misconception among many Python users about R’s utility and scope. This misconception seems to originate from two main factors. Firstly, in academic settings, R is typically introduced as a statistical tool, primarily taught by experts in mathematics or statistics. This approach often limits the exposure to R’s potential in data science, contrasting with Python, which is predominantly showcased in this context. Such a skewed presentation could contribute to the underestimation of R. Secondly, Python’s overwhelming presence on the internet, particularly in data science forums, reinforces its popularity. This larger user base naturally leads to a dominance in online discussions, overshadowing R’s presence. It’s also important to address a common oversight regarding the application of programming languages in industry settings.\nWhile the usage of Python in major companies like Google and Amazon is well-publicized, it’s a misconception to assume it’s their exclusive choice for data science tasks. In reality, many large corporations also incorporate R in their data science operations. Such as Airbnb, Amazon Web Service Ebay, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Twitter or Uber to name a few (source). Even companies made the choice to work mainly with R like Thinkr and Appsilon.\nIn fact R has solid libraries and tools for data science task: Quarto or Rmarkdown notebook for versatile publication, the Tidyverse ecosystem for data wrangling, the Tidymodels ecosystem or Caret or Mlr3 for machine learning, the Torch ecosystem for deep learning or Shiny for web application to name some famous ones.\nThe key takeaway is that R is far from being a dated, esoteric, and impenetrable statistical language confined to academic circles and favored only by nearing-retirement professors. Rather, it is a vibrant and dynamic language supported by a robust community deeply invested in data science. R is already a staple in production environments, actively used for a variety of real-world applications. The intent here is not to argue that R matches Python in terms of widespread usage – they are distinct languages with different strengths – but rather to challenge and correct the misconceptions some Python users might hold about R. This perspective aims to broaden the understanding and appreciation of what R brings to the table in the realm of data science."

It was my first programming language. That’s right, Python and I go way back to my days as a stats newbie, looking for something more robust than STATA.\nBack then, it was a showdown between R and Python for me. The online world seemed to be in a Python frenzy. Everywhere I looked, articles, tutorials, you name it – they all seemed to be chanting ‘Python, Python, Python!’ So, naturally, I jumped on the bandwagon. Python became my go-to for data science, my knight in shining armor, if you will."

    "text": "But then, plot twist! During my master’s, I was forced to learn R. And guess what? I was blown away. R was like this hidden gem, perfectly cut for data analysis. Slowly but surely, R started replacing Python in my data science toolkit. That got me thinking: Were those Python-preaching articles a bit too… biased?\nAs I dug deeper, it became clear. Many of those Python articles had misunderstood R, or worse, underestimated it. The craziest thing about all this is that many of these articles have literally pointed out things that aren’t true, such as the fact that R doesn’t have any good machine learning or visualization libraries. Also, some were comparing plain R with Python + Pandas + Numpy + ScikitLearn + TensorFlow. This realization hit me hard.\nThese articles and videos were much more subjective than they seemed in their choice of examples (sometimes these examples were already out of date) and concretely little effort was made in searching in R.\nLatter I ventured further, exploring languages like Julia and Nim. I needed performance, I craved compilation, and I was hunting for application. These new languages opened my eyes to a world beyond Python. Yet, Python remained in my arsenal, like an old friend you can’t let go of."

    "text": "Like all programming languages, Python has its shortcomings, which I can easily mention. These flaws become obvious when I compare it to other programming languages I use: - It’s slow (not compiled) - Has a huge dependency on C for heavy tasks - Possible to create desktop applications, but inappropriate - Has no built-in linear algebra functionality - No integrated dataframe management functionality - No integrated statistics or machine learning functionality - Object-oriented doesn’t integrate well with any of the above functionalities (Numpy and Pandas for instance feel weird to use personally)\nAnd the list goes on. But these aren’t my problem: no programming language is perfect.\nSo, here’s my ‘problem’ with Python: It’s not the language itself, but the popularity bias surrounding it. This bias blinds us, leading many to overlook alternatives that might be better suited for certain tasks. It creates a bubble, where Python is the be-all and end-all, and other languages are mere afterthoughts. This bubble isn’t just limiting; it’s dangerous for beginners.\nIn concrete terms, thanks to its versatility, Python can become a comfort zone from which it’s hard to escape. But focusing on just one language and ignoring the alternatives can lead to a number of problems: - Performance: In the case of languages like Python, performance is limited and you have to rely on libraries that depend on other, more powerful languages for specific uses (C/C++). What’s more, when it comes to writing high-performance programs in their own right, it’s a bad idea to write them in Python or other supposedly faster alternatives (Pypy or Cython) when you could be using other more powerful and almost equally easy-to-use languages like Julia, Mojo or Nim. This solve the two language problem in a better way. - Ecosystem: Even if Python could virtually be used in many circumstances, there are languages that have ecosystems better suited to certain tasks, such as JavaScript for Web development, R for statistics, Kotlin for application development or Rust for system development. - Career: It’s possible to make a career out of a single programming language. The chances of working with just one language seem high in a rare programming language. In the case of a language like Python (which everyone uses), it’s more appropriate to have another language to back up your skills. Even in a field like data science, it’s very often required to know how to use SQL or R in addition to Python. What’s more, it’s not only machine learning skills that are required, but also knowledge of statistics, architecture (AWS, Azure, etc.) and other skills. What’s more, having more than one language means more career opportunities.\nDon’t get me wrong, Python is great. I still use it for many projects (nice for scripting). But the key takeaway? Don’t get cloistered in a single language. Explore, experiment, and most importantly, keep an open mind. Each language has its strengths, its charm, and yes, its quirks.\nSo, whether you’re a Python pro, an R enthusiast, or a Julia fan, remember: the world of programming is vast and varied. Embrace it. And hey, who knows? You might just find your new programming soulmate."

    "text": "So, we’ve talked about the language, its strengths, and the bias around it. Now, let’s explore the darker side of popularity bias and the hit-parade effect in programming.\nYou see, popularity bias isn’t unique to Python or even programming. It’s a widespread phenomenon, where popularity feeds more popularity, often overshadowing other equally or more deserving options. In music, it’s the hit-parade effect – the more a song is played, the more popular it becomes, regardless of its quality.\nThis hit-parade effect seeps into the world of programming too. Python, no doubt a great language, has benefitted from this. Its popularity has skyrocketed, not solely because of its merits but partly due to a self-perpetuating cycle of popularity. It’s like a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger and bigger.\nBut why is this dangerous? Well, think about it.

Here’s the nitty-gritty:\n\nChoose your Quest: Find a project that piques your interest. It could be anything, from a complex machine learning library to a simple script that automates meme generation (because who doesn’t love memes?). Keep in mind to chose projects that goes into your interest and that can bring you joy and wisdom. Even if the project seems chalenging and you think you don’t have the level, just ask the owner of the project what you can bring to it at your level. Even doing the documentation is a good way to start (See bellow in ==complet here==). Sometimes owner of project write themselve what are the things to take care of and openly ask for help in specific area (or in the whole project).\nFork it: Fork the repository to your account. Think of it as creating your own magic clone of the project where you can tinker without disturbing the original.\nClone it: Clone the forked repository onto your local machine. Basically, it’s like summoning your cloned project from the cloud onto your computer.\nCreate a Branch: It’s always a good practice to create a new branch for your changes. Consider this as creating a parallel universe where your changes won’t affect the main storyline.\nMake Changes: Here comes the fun part. Dive in and make your changes. Remember, no contribution is too small.\nCommit and Push: Once you’re satisfied with your changes, commit them with a clear, informative message and push them to your forked repository.\nPull Request (PR): Back on the GitHub site, you can now open a PR against the original repository. It is sending your change to the main project online. Then the owner of the project can read your changes and see if they can accept it.\nWait: Now, the repository owner reviews your changes. If they like them, they’ll merge them into the project. Congrats, you just made your first contribution!\nCelebrate: Grab yourself a cake, you’ve earned it!"

Because in this realm, the structure is your friend. You’ll find it’s not just facile but rather enjoyable!\n\nWhy Contribute to R Packages?\nR packages are the lifeblood of the R ecosystem, facilitating data analysis, visualization, and much more. When you contribute to R packages, you are helping to enhance the functionality, efficiency, and reliability of these packages.\n\n\nHow to Contribute to R Packages?\nThe best ressource to learn how to create solid packages in R is the following book freely available online: R packages\nHere are some interesting steps to guide you through the process:\n\nIdentify the Package: First, identify the R package you want to contribute to. It could be a R package you use often or one you believe could benefit from your magical touch. For instance you could have noticed specific error or way to improve it in your taste that could please others.\nCheck the Package Guidelines: Each R package usually has its own contribution guidelines. Take a moment to read these, as they often contain valuable information on the package’s style and testing procedures. Remember, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\nSetup Your R Environment: You will need an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. RStudio is a fantastic choice (VS Code is also a good choice). Next, install the devtools package. This package provide functions to simplify package development and maintenance.\nTo install devtools, you can use:\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nFork and Clone the Package: Similar to the steps described earlier, fork the repository of the package to your GitHub account, and then clone it onto your local machine.\nLoad the Package: To load the package in R, use the load_all() function from the devtools package. This function loads all the functions and data in the package into your R environment, which lets you test your changes quickly and easily.\ndevtools::load_all()\nBranch Out: As with other contributions, it’s wise to create a new branch for your changes.\nMake Changes: Sprinkle your magic dust. You can add features, fix bugs, improve documentation, or even enhance performance.\nTest Your Changes: Testing is crucial. Use the test() function from the devtools package to run the package’s test cases and ensure your changes don’t break anything.\ndevtools::test()\nDocument Your Changes: Use the document() function from devtools to update the package documentation.\ndevtools::document()\nCommit, Push, and PR: Once satisfied with your changes, commit them with a meaningful message, push to your forked repository, and open a PR against the original repository.\n\nR package development has its charms and challenges, but the joy of contributing and improving the package for the entire R community is undoubtedly enchanting."

    "title": "Exciting Insights from the 2023 Posit conference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been eagerly anticipating the public release of the videos from the recent Posit conference about one of my favorite programming languages: R. For someone who has gained so much from previous editions of this conference, the wait was filled with a mix of anticipation and excitement. Knowing the discussions and advancements shared in these conferences has always been a key way for me to stay up-to-date and catch up with the latest in R programming. And now, with 108 videos available, it’s like a treasure trove of knowledge just waiting to be explored!\nThe highlight for me this year was twofold. First, I was looking forward to learning about the developments and new features of two innovative tools, Quarto and WebR. These tools represent significant advancements in our field, and I couldn’t wait to see what they had to offer. Even though I was fairly up to date on the subject, seeing these tools in action is still very interesting. Second, the talks about packages always catch my interest. They’re crucial for understanding the practical applications and integrations of R and how the community grow.\nWhile the applications of R in production and academia are undeniably relevant, they aren’t the core focus of this blog post. Instead, what always amazes me is the depth and variety of topics covered, which seems to expand with every passing year. This year was no exception, and I found myself pleasantly surprised by some of the content.\nIn this blog post, I want to share my favorite talks from the conference and dive into why they resonated with me. I hope that by sharing these insights, I can spark the same excitement and passion for programming and data science in you, my readers.\n\n\n\nSpeeding up Big Data Manipulation: We’ll delve into a package, {duckplyr}, that is revolutionizing the way we handle large datasets. Expect to see some groundbreaking methods that are making data manipulation fast.\nInline Variables: A deep dive into how inline variables are changing the game in coding and how the {epox} package is boosting it.\nUI for UI: An intriguing concept that’s reshaping our approach to user interface design. We will see how {ShinyUiEditor} can make you life easier for building Shiny apps.\nQuarto talks: A dedicated section where we’ll unpack the latest features and advancements in Quarto. If you’re as excited about this tool as I am, you’re in for a treat!\nWebR talks: Similarly, we’ll dive into what’s new with WebR. The developments here are nothing short of revolutionary.\nOther Interesting Talks: And of course, there were many more gems in the conference. I’ll highlight some talks that, while they might not have been in the limelight, offered incredible discoveries.\n\nAs we embark on this journey through the highlights of the conference, I invite you to share my enthusiasm and optimism for the future of data science. The world of programming is continually evolving, and it’s an exciting time to be part of this field. Let’s dive in and discover the wonders of programming together!\n\n\n\n\nThis year’s conference brought a notable change: the host company’s shift from “RSudio” to “Posit”. This isn’t just a name change; it symbolizes a commitment to embracing a wider range of programming languages, extending beyond the familiar R to include Python and more. This move reflects an understanding that the data science world is diverse and ever-evolving.\nInitially, some R enthusiasts were concerned that Posit might pivot away from R in favor of the trendier Python language. However, these fears were assuaged as the conference unfolded, showcasing a balanced focus on both R and Python (next on the list: Julia?).\nDespite the initial apprehension, this year’s conference mirrored the richness and depth of its predecessors. The variety of talks confirmed Posit’s dedication to supporting a spectrum of programming languages and topics.\n\n\n\n\nAt this year’s conference, Kirill Müller unveiled something pretty cool for us data scientist: “duckplyr.” It is a new tool, aiming to handle big data. Think of it as a turbocharged bridge between DuckDB and dplyr, but with the familiar dplyr vibe.\n\n\n\nI have been on this data journey for a while, hopping from data.table to dtplyr, to dbplyr, to dbcooper, to arrow and duckdb and now I am aiming at “duckplyr.” Kirill Müller’s talk showed how it can make our dplyr code go through data in DuckDB – faster and smoother, especially with those tricky queries. And guess what? There’s more to come, like handling complex data types better.\nI’m always looking for something that can make my data work feel less like a chore and more like a breeze. “Duckplyr” might just be the next thing in my toolbox. It’s exciting to see tools evolving to keep up with our big data challenges.\nIn short, “duckplyr” is shaping up to be a game-changer for big data manipulation. Can’t wait to see where this goes!\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrick Aden-Buie’s introduction of ‘epoxy’ at the latest conference was a standout moment for data presentation. ‘Epoxy’ brings a fresh perspective to presenting data in Quarto and RMarkdown, making it easy to integrate formatted data into text (markdown).\n\n\n\nThis tool transforms how we embed data, such as currencies or percentages, directly into our reports, enhancing readability and comprehension. Beyond its practical applications, ‘epoxy’ intrigued me. Could its custom code chunks be a result of Lua scripting? This adds an exciting dimension to its functionality.\n‘Epoxy’ is all about clarity and engagement in data reporting. It’s a game-changer for making reports not only informative but also visually appealing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Strayer’s introduction of ShinyUIEditor at the recent Posit conference was a standout moment for anyone interested in Shiny app development. Before encountering this tool, I leaned towards Nim and Python for app creation. But ShinyUIEditor has reignited my enthusiasm for Shiny apps (WebR and Shinylive contributed to it too).\n\n\n\nShinyUIEditor goes beyond basic app design. It’s a real-world solution for creating interactive Shiny dashboards with ease. Nick highlighted how the editor simplifies the UI setup. What’s impressive about ShinyUIEditor is its drag-and-drop functionality. It makes adding and configuring UI elements a breeze. Nick’s demonstration of building a Shiny app from the ground up showcased this simplicity and efficiency. The ShinyUIEditor isn’t just about layout; it also integrates interactivity by connecting inputs and outputs. The ability to add Markdown text for explanations further enhances its utility.\nShinyUIEditor has finally entered its Beta phase! Nick also hinted at future developments for the ShinyUIEditor, promising an even more robust tool for Shiny developers.\nThe ShinyUIEditor has transformed my view of Shiny app development. It’s making app creation more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. I’m excited to delve back into Shiny apps, thanks to this innovative tool.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a fervent advocate of Quarto and its core features, binge-watching the conference videos was like a treasure hunt for me. Three talks, in particular, caught my eye, each unveiling features of Quarto that not only impressed but also sparked my curiosity and enthusiasm.\n\n(1) Extending Quarto(2) Parameterized Quarto(3) Reproducible manuscript with Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard’s talk was a deep dive into the world of Quarto extensions. He showcased a variety of them, including eye-catching short code extensions for icons like Font Awesome and Lordicon. His demonstration of “qformat” for number formatting in Quarto documents was particularly intriguing. The emphasis on good documentation and the mention of the “Awesome Quarto” GitHub repository as a comprehensive resource was a valuable takeaway for anyone looking to expand their Quarto capabilities.\n\n\n\nJadey’s transition from an environmental technician to a data scientist and her journey with parameterized reporting was nothing short of inspiring. She highlighted how parameterized reporting transforms static reports into dynamic documents with placeholders for data, making them more adaptable and relevant. Her focus on designing for accessibility and her practical tips on report styling were especially enlightening. This talk opened my eyes to the possibilities of parameterizing Quarto documents, an approach I’m eager to implement.\n\n\n\nMine’s presentation on creating reproducible scientific manuscripts using Quarto was a game changer. She shed light on how Quarto projects can manage complexity in scientific projects and integrate various tools and languages. The introduction of the manuscript project type in Quarto, enabling the creation of manuscripts in multiple formats with embedded computations, was a highlight. This feature elevates Quarto from a tool for authoring academic work to a platform for truly transparent and reproducible research. Now there’s no excuse: it’s very easy to share all your code and collaborate with colleagues using different methods.\n\n\n\nEach of these talks showcased different aspects of Quarto’s versatility and power. From enhancing the visual appeal with extensions to the practicality of parameterized reporting and the groundbreaking approach to reproducible manuscripts, Quarto is proving to be an indispensable tool in data science. As someone who initially leaned towards other programming languages for app creation, these Quarto features have rekindled my interest and excitement in working with Shiny apps and Quarto documents (And that’s not all - wait until you see the next part!).\n\n\n\n\n\nWebR is making waves in the R community, offering powerful capabilities for teaching and app creation, despite being in its nascent stage (version 0.2.3). Its impact on Shiny app development, particularly through serverless applications via Shinylive, has rekindled my interest in the platform.\n\n(1) Magic with WebAssembly(2) R-Shiny without server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Stagg provided a succinct overview of WebR, emphasizing its ability to run R code directly in web browsers without a supporting server. He discussed how Web Assembly enables WebR to operate across various platforms and showcased its application in educational tools and documentation.

He discussed the evolution of serverless Shiny apps and their potential in interactive web-based applications. Despite some limitations like slower start times, Joe’s talk suggested a bright future for Shinylive in enhancing Shiny’s capabilities.\n\n\n\nThese presentations have heightened my excitement for WebR’s future. I’ve explored every feature that WebR offers, from engaging with interactive code chunks in Quarto and crafting Shiny apps using Shinylive, to integrating R within JavaScript via the webr npm library. The next venture on my journey with WebR is to delve into the creation of standalone Electron apps, harnessing its vast capabilities. Will it works?\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid a conference rich in sessions about Quarto, WebR, and LLM, one presentation stood out for its innovative approach to data visualization. Deepsha Menghani’s session brilliantly demonstrated how to bring data to life through interactivity and animation. I highly recommand this talk!\n\n\n\nDeepsha Menghani used the character Roy Kent from “Ted Lasso” as a focal point to explore advanced data visualization techniques. She skillfully employed animation to depict Roy Kent’s frequent use of a certain expletive, adding a layer of time to the story with the Plotly package. Further enhancing the interactive experience, she introduced the concept of Roy Kent’s ‘f-score’ and implemented a checkbox filter, allowing viewers to tailor the data exploration to their preferences. Additionally, Deepsha showcased the power of linking different plots to provide a comprehensive view of how specific episodes impact broader trends.\nShe also stressed the importance of a balanced approach in visualization. While emphasizing that tools like animations and interactivity are powerful, she cautioned against their overuse, which can lead to cluttered and confusing visuals. Her presentation was not just about static data; it extended into dynamic, interactive realms, mentioning the use of Crosstalk and the integration of these techniques into Shiny apps.\n\n\n\nThis presentation stood out as a gem in the conference, highlighting the evolving art of data visualization. I’m determined to use the tools and concepts presented in this video to create better visualizations, dashboards and interactive applications. Truly brilliant!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this blog post comes to a close, I am once again reminded of the invaluable learning experiences these conferences provide.

Today, we’re here to chat about a topic so fascinating that it might just outshine your grandmother’s knitting saga. It’s the “Project” feature in RStudio. Yes, you heard it right - it’s time to unravel the secret weapon that will catapult you to new heights in your R journey.\nBefore we embark, let’s clarify something. What’s RStudio, you ask? RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. If R is a car, then RStudio is the fancy garage where you improve it up and give it a good polish. But hey, even in the best garages, there are tools that are underused – and ‘projects’ is the underappreciated power drill that’s gathering dust in the corner."

    "text": "What are projects in RStudio?\nImagine having a room so messy, you can’t tell the difference between your cat and a fur-lined sweater. Now, think of projects as a giant storage box that allows you to organize your mess (or codes, in our case) and avoid getting your data files, scripts, and outputs mixed up. Remember, no one wants to find a sock in their sandwich!\nSo, in RStudio, a Project is essentially a way to keep all relevant files and specific settings in a single place. Every time you open a Project, RStudio knows exactly where it is, it gets its bearings, and has the sense not to look for your datasets in your downloads or image folder.\nprojects are like trusty sidekicks in the world of programming. They keep our work organized and shielded from the chaos of the digital universe. Just like RStudio’s Rproject, other editors have their own quirky projects. Visual Studio has projects, Sublime Text has projects, and even your grandma’s ancient text editor might have a project feature. projects are like clean bubbles for our code, ensuring it remains unperturbed by the messy dance of files on our computers.\nNote: stop making excuses\nListen up, fellow statisticians! Just because you’re more into numbers than code doesn’t mean you get a free pass on staying desorganized. When you’re knee-deep in dissertations or buried under a pile of homework, you don’t scatter your papers haphazardly around the room, do you? No way! You keep everything in one place, separated from the rest of the chaos. It’s like having a binder for each subject and dividers for each assignment—clear, simple, and organized. projects are no different, my friends! They’re like those fancy binders, but for your digital life. They corral all your code, data, and documentation into one neat little package, shielding it from the tumultuous whirlwind of your computer’s file system."

    "text": "Why should you use them?\n\n1. Stay organized\nImagine having to find the latest script in a haystack of documents or a file saved under a particularly “creative” name like “final_script_v3.2_final_FINAL.R”. A nightmare, isn’t it? With projects, every file you need is in one place - no more, no less. It’s like having a drawer labeled ‘Socks’: you’re not going to find a shirt in there!\n\n\n2. Maintain your working directory\nYour working directory is like your home base in R. With projects, every time you open a particular Project, RStudio sets the working directory to the project’s directory. No more lengthy codes with numerous file paths. It’s like waking up in your own bed every morning, not in the middle of a supermarket.\n\n\n3. Work on multiple projects\nLet’s say you’re juggling different projects, like a statistical analysis of avocado prices and a predictive model for the lottery. You don’t want your avocados messing with your lotto dreams, right? With RStudio projects, you can keep them separate and switch between them seamlessly. It’s like having different rooms for different tasks in your house.\n\n\n4. Share and collaborate\nIf you’ve tried to share your R code with someone who couldn’t run it because they didn’t have their directories set up like yours, then you’ll love projects. They allow other people to run your code without getting tangled up in missing file errors. It’s the equivalent of sending someone a packed lunch with instructions instead of sending them to forage in your fridge.\nIn conclusion, using projects in RStudio is like having a personal assistant who’s a pro at organizing, file managing, and ensuring you don’t get your socks mixed up with your sandwiches. And trust me, in the bustling kitchen of R programming, you’re going to want that!"

    "text": "The cost of ignoring Rstudio’s projects\nWhile coding in R can be a delightful and rewarding experience, there’s a peculiar habit that seems to persist among some developers—a reluctance to embrace the wonders of Rproject. In this blog post, we shall explore the mishaps and frustrations that arise from ignoring Rproject, highlighting the importance of this indispensable tool. So buckle up, and let’s embark on this humorous journey together!\n\n1. Absolute paths and why you should avoid using them\n\nIf you don’t know what absolute paths are\nAh, absolute paths and relative paths, the dynamic duo of file navigation! Think of them as Batman and Robin, but with fewer capes and more directory drama.\nAbsolute paths are like treasure maps that provide the exact coordinates to your desired file or directory. They start from the root of your computer.\nExamples\nWindows:\n\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Project\\Folder\\File.txt\"\n\nMac:\n\"/Users/Username/Documents/Project/Folder/File.txt\"\n\nLinux:\n\"/home/Username/Documents/Project/Folder/File.txt\"\nOn the other hand, relative paths are more like giving directions to your friend using landmarks. You guide them based on his current location. It’s like saying, “Go three steps to the right, pass the coffee shop, and you’ll find the mystical file you seek”.\nThe example assume that your current working directory (where your R script or project is located) is at: C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Project\\\nTo navigate to a file named File.txt located in the Folder directory within the current working directory, the relative path would be:\nWindows:\n'Folder\\File.txt'\n\nMac:\n'Folder/File.txt'\n\nLinux:\n'Folder/File.txt'\nIn R, to use relative paths, you simply do the same. If you want more options simply embrace the power of the dots! Use “..” to navigate up one level in the directory hierarchy and “.” to represent the current directory.\nAssume that your current working directory (where your R script or project is located) is at: C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Project\\\nTo navigate to the folder Document which is one level up you would use:\nWindows:\n'..\\'\n\nMac:\n'../'\n\nLinux:\n'../'\nNow, here comes the thrilling part! Inside RStudio, imagine the tab key as a magical wand. When you’re typing a file or directory name within quotation marks, tap that tab key, and behold! A navigation bar appears, offering you a smorgasbord of choices. So, unleash your inner explorer, play with the relative paths, and tap that tab key like a maestro.\n\n\nBack to the dramatic inconvenience of absolute paths\nPicture this: You’ve written a fantastic piece of code in R, filled with wit, charm, and impeccable logic. But there’s a twist—your code contains an absolute file path. Now, when someone else attempts to run your code on their machine, it’s as if you’ve sent them on a mystery tour, wandering through file directories to locate the missing pieces. Be careful! Using the setwd() function (and even worse, the ctrl+shift+H shortcut) doesn’t solve the problem at all. You’re still using absolute paths, which will have to be changed manually by your victim - sorry, I mean colleague! Avoid this problem by utilizing Rproject, which enables you to maintain relative paths and keeps everyone on the same page.\n\n\n\n2. Mixed files\nImagine a symphony performance where each musician plays a different piece entirely. Irritating, right? Well, that’s what happens when you have mixed files scattered across different locations. One file resides in your “Documents” folder, while another hides in the depths of your “Downloads” folder. When collaborating or sharing your code, chaos ensues, leaving others scratching their heads. Rproject corrals all your files into a neat and tidy package, ensuring harmony and preserving the sanity of those who dare to read your code.\n\n\n3. Versioning woes\nAh, the bane of every programmer’s existence—versioning woes. Without Rproject, you enter the realm of time travel bugs, where code from a different era unexpectedly emerges. You find yourself debugging issues that were resolved ages ago, akin to encountering a T-Rex in a modern metropolis. With Rproject, version control systems like Git become your trusty time-traveling companions, allowing you to journey through the annals of code history with ease. Let’s not forget renv, but it will be the topic for another blog post!\n\n\n4. Size doesn’t matter\n“But my project is tiny! I don’t need Rproject,” you protest. Well, dear reader, even the tiniest projects deserve some love and organization. Rproject is not solely for colossal undertakings but a best practice that can save you from future headaches. Plus, it’s a delightful excuse to embark on an adventure, designing your own little universe within RStudio. Alternatively, you can always create a “Test” folder .\nNow, we understand that sometimes you just want to run a quick test, free from the constraints of a formal project. Fear not, intrepid adventurer! You can alter the default path of RStudio and create a whimsical “Test” folder where you can safely experiment and play. It’s a haven for all your quick tests and a sanctuary for spontaneous code escapades (see below in “Test and Project - Yin and Yang”)."

For our R enthusiasts, let’s dive into the “R” folder. Inside, we’ll unveil the secrets of a well-structured R programming project.\n\n\nTest and project - Yin and Yang\nBehold, the dynamic duo of the R folder—the “Test” and “Project” folders. These siblings play distinct roles in your coding journey, ensuring order and clarity.\nThe “Test” folder is your haven for experimentation and ad-hoc code trials. When you’re not working within a formal Rproject, this folder becomes your working directory. It’s here that you can tinker, test, and push the boundaries of your R code without affecting your main projects. To make life easier, let’s make the “Test” folder your permanent default working directory in RStudio.\nIn RStudio, navigate to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; General Look for the Default working directory and select Browse... next to it. Find and select your “Test” folder. Voila! RStudio will now use the “Test” folder as the default working directory whenever you’re not working within an Rproject.\nOn the other hand, the “Project” folder is where the work truly unfolds. When creating an Rproject in RStudio, it will generate a dedicated project folder with all the necessary files and configurations. You have the freedom to structure this folder as you please, organizing your code, data, documentation, and any additional resources. It’s the ideal place to encapsulate the entirety of your project, ensuring that everything stays organized and coherent.\n\n\nCreate RStudio’s Rproject\nNow, you may be wondering, “How do I create an Rproject in RStudio?”\nIn RStudio, navigate to File -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory -&gt; Empty Project Choose the location of your Project folder within the “R” folder, provide a name for your project, and click Create Project Voila! RStudio conjures an Rproject, complete with an “.Rproj” file and a wondrous new world awaits.\nIf you already have an existing folder, it is the same way. Click New Project in RStudio’s File menu. Choose Existing Directory click Create Project. The project will take the folder name.\nWithin your newly minted Rproject, you can work correctly while basking in the organized files, version control, and a consistent working directory. RStudio conveniently sets the working directory to the project’s root folder, saving you from horrible absolute paths."

    "text": "Whether you’re diving into your first programming language or adding another to your repertoire (let’s become polyglot!), there’s one thing many of us share: the journey of learning to code on our own. In today’s world, it seems easy to embark on this journey, given the plethora of resources at our fingertips. However, this abundance brings its own set of unique challenges.\nLearning to code independently often leads to what is known as the famous “tutorial hell.” It’s a common trap where learners, in their quest for the perfect guide, find themselves circling in a maze of tutorials. This endless search makes every tutorial appear indecipherable. And even when the right tutorials are found, months can pass in study without the satisfying sense of real progress, leading to weariness and frustration.\nAnother significant hurdle is the ever-elusive ‘perfect time’ to learn. Many struggle to find or make time in their busy schedules to dedicate to coding, further prolonging their learning journey. If you need advice on that we have a nice blog post for you: “The two-minute rule for busy coder/learner”\nBut fear not! The following 7 steps are designed to help you navigate these challenges more smoothly and effectively, ensuring you won’t face the same obstacles that have hindered others. These steps are:\n\nMake a roadmap: Plan your learning journey.\nChoose the right resources: Select materials that suit your learning style.\nTake notes along the way: Documenting your progress aids in retention.\nLearn the basics thoroughly: Strong foundations are key.\nEngage in projects: Apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.\nRevisit the basics: Regularly reinforce fundamental concepts.\nCollaborate: Learn from and with others.\n\nIn the rest of this article, we will dive deep into each of these steps, providing you with practical advice and insider tips to make your coding journey a successful and enjoyable one. So, let’s get started and turn those coding dreams into reality!\n\n\n\nNote: If you exactly know what you want to learn you can skip this part!\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed about where to start your coding journey, you’re not alone. “What should I learn first?” is an increasingly common question, not just due to the vast array of options available, but also because of the ongoing ‘wars’ between different programming languages, each claiming to be the best. Navigating through these passionate and often subjective debates can be tricky. It can lead to two main issues: difficulty in making a choice (which breeds procrastination) or ending up with a language that doesn’t really suit your needs.\nTake, for instance, the classic debates like “The best programming language for…”, “Which JavaScript Framework to choose?”, or the famous “Python vs. R”. These discussions are recurrent and can be more confusing than helpful. So, how do you cut through the noise?\nThe simplest approach is to avoid starting your search on the Internet. Instead, make a list of your own needs and objectives. On the Internet, there’s a risk that others will decide for you, pitching a language as the be-all and end-all (though, thankfully, not everyone does this). Approaching with a clear idea of what you want to achieve helps limit undue influence and indecision.\nAlso, consider the support and resources available around you (friends, colleagues or books) and align them with your personal or professional plans. If you’re still in doubt, it’s okay to pick an option at random or go with a ‘default’ choice. Don’t linger too long in this phase of decision-making. Remember, you can always pivot to another language later – no learning is ever wasted.\nThe beauty of programming is that the core concepts are often transferable between languages. Different programming languages are just tools – it’s how you use them that matters. For example, if you start with Python due to its simplicity and later decide to switch to Java, you’ll find that many concepts like loops, variables, and data structures are similar, just with different syntax.\n\n\nIt’s a legitimate question - as a beginner, we don’t necessarily know how to translate our needs into clear, domain-specific objectives. Before going on the Internet, it’s always wiser to talk it over with a more advanced acquaintance. Now, in the age of artificial intelligence, an in-depth discussion with a model like ChatGPT can be enlightening (but becareful it might be biased!).\nIn summary, step zero is about making an informed, yet not overthought, decision. Choose a language or a technology based on your current needs, availability of resources, and your future goals. And remember, the journey of coding is flexible – it’s perfectly fine to change paths as you grow and discover more about your interests and the tech world.\n\n\n\n\nThe journey of learning to code is akin to embarking on a voyage – having a roadmap is crucial. The path of least resistance often leads to joining online curricula or courses on platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/, Udemy, or freeCodeCamp. While these courses are beneficial and circumvent the need to design your own program, they are, by nature, very standardized. They may not align perfectly with your objectives or your preferred learning style.\nIf you find that these courses don’t meet your unique needs, crafting your own roadmap is a viable alternative. It’s tempting to dive straight into tutorials and start coding, but this approach can often lead to confusion and discouragement. The key is to have a clear goal. You should be able to answer questions like, “Why do I want to learn this programming language?” or “What do I specifically want to create with it?” Remember, a programming language can serve many purposes – from developing websites (like HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development) to creating data analysis tools (such as Python for data science).\nOnce you’ve defined your objective, the next step is to break it down into smaller, achievable, and measurable goals. For instance, if your aim is to build a website, start by learning basic HTML and CSS. Then, gradually progress to more complex tasks like JavaScript and back-end development.\nWith these smaller goals in mind, order them and compile them into a learning roadmap. The more personalized your roadmap, the better. However, it’s essential to start with the basics regardless of your ultimate goal. At this stage, your roadmap doesn’t have to be incredibly detailed, but you should at least know what skills you need to acquire at each stage.\nDon’t underestimate the importance of this planning phase. Dedicate a good amount of time to it – up to two weeks, if necessary. During this period, don’t hesitate to seek advice from more advanced individuals or even artificial intelligence platforms. Compare your plan with roadmaps recommended by others to ensure you’re on the right track.\nRemember, your roadmap is not set in stone. It should be a living document that evolves as you gain more knowledge and understanding of the subject. You can’t know everything from the outset, and it’s perfectly fine to adapt your plan as you progress. Especially when it comes to projects (see “6. Engage in projects”).\nIn conclusion, a well-thought-out roadmap tailored to your specific goals and learning style is an invaluable tool in your journey to learn coding. It provides direction, keeps you focused, and helps measure your progress, setting you up for a successful and fulfilling learning experience.\n\n\n\nSelecting the right resources is a crucial step in making your roadmap more tangible. It’s not necessary to have resources for every step right away; you can discover new resources as you progress. The key is not to get bogged down in finding the ‘best’ resources, as this can be a laborious and often futile task. Focus on finding resources that best suit your learning style.\nTo help you with this, ask yourself some guiding questions: - “Am I willing to spend money to learn?” - “Do I prefer paper or digital resources?” - “Do I prefer static or interactive resources?”\nFor each of these combinations, there are corresponding resource types: - If you’re open to spending money and prefer paper resources, consider investing in comprehensive coding books. - If you prefer digital and are willing to invest, paid online courses on platforms like Udemy or Pluralsight offer structured learning paths. - For those who prefer free resources, there’s a wealth of YouTube tutorials and online documentation. - If interactive learning is your style, platforms like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp offer hands-on coding exercises.\nFor more interactive learning ressources (exercices) I wrote a blog post here: “Free programming exercice website”.\nIt’s important to note that preferences might change based on your experience level. For example, if you’re learning your second programming language, you might find more advanced resources like technical blogs or community forums more beneficial.\nHowever, each type of resource has its shortcomings. Books can become outdated, online courses might not cover the latest technologies, and videos can sometimes lack depth. Don’t hesitate to ask for recommendations from experienced coders or online communities for a list of useful resources.\nA great way to start strong is by taking a crash course (written or video) of maximum 2 hours, and coding along with it. This approach helps you quickly grasp the syntax and philosophy of the language. Remember, it’s crucial to practice actively and not just passively follow along with the theory. For more advanced programmer with a good understanding of programming concepts reaching their new programming language a website like “learning x in y minutes” might be a good ressource.\nKeep in mind that there’s no such thing as a perfect resource. It’s okay to change your resources as you progress. The most important thing is to work hard and stick with it for as long as possible.\nNow that the beginning of your roadmap is set, you’re ready to embark on your coding journey with confidence. Remember, the journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single keystroke!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section emphasizes a good practice crucial for avoiding stagnation and deviation in your coding journey: taking notes throughout the learning process. While some programming languages like Julia have exceptional documentation, others like Python boast a plethora of tutorials by individuals. Then there are languages with more challenging documentation, such as Haskell or Nim. But ultimately, the best documentation is the one you create for yourself.\nThis can take the form of personalized notes in a style that suits you best, be it a text document, a Word file, or a Markdown file. Another vital type of documentation is the code you write yourself. Ensure it’s clean and well-commented (but not excessively so). This code becomes a valuable resource when you need an example later. Additionally, organize your code and folders effectively to easily navigate your work.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to seeking help, autonomy should always be your first approach. This means trying to solve problems on your own by testing and researching, sometimes for hours, before seeking external assistance. Remember, making mistakes is a fundamental part of learning. Relying too heavily on others for answers – whether it’s a more experienced colleague or the internet – deprives you of the crucial problem-solving experience at the heart of programming.\nThe risk with relying on artificial intelligence for help is that it can provide answers without limit, which can lead to a dependency on external solutions. Without honing your problem-solving skills, your learning becomes slower and less effective, leaving you reliant on others or tools for coding. Strive for independence.\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to learn the best practices and tricks of the language you’re studying. The beauty of these tips is that they can be learned at different stages of your journey. However, the sooner you incorporate them, the more quickly you’ll boost your productivity. Embracing these best practices early on is always beneficial.\nIn summary, keep detailed notes, stay organized, seek autonomy in problem-solving, and continuously learn best practices and tricks in your chosen programming language. These steps are fundamental in developing a strong foundation in coding, leading you towards becoming a proficient and independent coder.\n\n\n\n\nThe foundation of understanding any programming language lies in mastering its basics, which is why it’s a crucial first step in your roadmap. However, learning the basics isn’t just about grasping the syntax; it’s equally important to understand the philosophy behind the language. The best way to solidify your understanding of these basics is through practice exercises, underscoring the importance of choosing the right resources.\n\n\nThere are several universal concepts common to all programming languages that you need to ensure you master:\n\nVariable declaration: Understanding how to create and use variables.\nData types: Familiarity with different types of data (e.g., integers, strings).\nControl structures: Knowledge of if-else statements, loops, etc.\nFunctions/methods: Creating and utilizing reusable blocks of code.\nInput/output operations: Handling user input and system output.\nError handling: Managing and responding to errors in code.\nBasic data structures: Using arrays, lists, and dictionaries.\n\nAs data scientists or statisticians, we have the impression that these concepts are not important to us as long as we don’t code as a programmer (we can use R without knowing how to program, for example), but this deprives us of essential knowledge that will help us in our learning process (in particular, understanding and resolving errors).\n\n\n\n\nTake your time and don’t rush the learning process.\nPractice as much as possible with small coding exercises.\nUse your notes as a reference and keep updating them.\nDon’t be too hard on yourself.\nDon’t try to understand everything perfectly, you will come back to it latter if needed.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an estimated learning time for various programming languages (non-exhaustive list), ordered from easiest to most difficult:\n\n\n\nProgramming language\nLevel of difficulty\nEstimated learning time\n\n\n\n\nLua\nEasy\n2-3 weeks\n\n\nPython\nEasy\n3-4 weeks\n\n\nR\nEasy-Moderate\n4-5 weeks\n\n\nJulia\nModerate\n5-6 weeks\n\n\nJavaScript\nModerate\n5-6 weeks\n\n\nGo\nModerate-Hard\n6-8 weeks\n\n\nJava\nModerate-Hard\n6-8 weeks\n\n\nRust\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\nNim\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\nC/C++\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\n\nRemember, it’s okay not to master everything at first. Your understanding will deepen as you work on projects and revisit the basics later. The most important thing is to take comprehensive notes during your learning process. You will come back to it latter!\nIn conclusion, give yourself time to thoroughly learn and understand the basics of your chosen programming language. This solid foundation will set you up for success as you progress in your coding journey.\nWarning: You don’t want to go too fast, but you don’t want to take too long either. For the moment, it’s technical knowledge, but for it to become technical skills, we’re going to have to start working on projects, and as quickly as possible (see bellow).\n\n\n\n\nProjects are arguably the most effective way to learn programming. They encompass an array of steps, reflections, and errors, making them instrumental in understanding and applying the various tools and concepts you’ve learned. Projects make the abstract concepts tangible and help you start learning autonomously. If you haven’t already included projects in your roadmap, it’s time to do so. Projects will not only enhance your learning but also serve as benchmarks for self-evaluation.\n\n\nInitially, choose a very guided project, preferably one accompanied by a video or tutorial that leads you step-by-step. This will help you understand the project flow and the intricacies involved. After completing a guided project, move on to less structured projects. If you struggle to find suitable projects for your programming language, seek inspiration from the internet or ask someone experienced to help you select. Don’t hesitate to look at projects in other programming languages for ideas.\nFor subsequent projects, consider working on something personal and meaningful to you. This approach keeps motivation high and makes the learning process more enjoyable.\n\n\n\nNon-exhaustive list\n\nData scientist\n\nBeginner: Analyze a dataset using basic statistical methods.\nIntermediate: Create a predictive model using machine learning.\nAdvanced: Develop a complex data visualization tool.\n\nWeb developer\n\nBeginner: Build a simple personal or portfolio website.\nIntermediate: Develop a dynamic web application with a database.\nAdvanced: Create a full-stack application with user authentication.\n\nCyber security\n\nBeginner: Set up a basic secure network.\nIntermediate: Conduct a penetration test on a test environment.\nAdvanced: Develop a tool for automated security testing.\n\n\nIf you find yourself struggling with a project, it’s a sign you might need to revisit the basics or seek more documentation. It’s completely normal to oscillate between learning and applying. Creativity is a key asset in this phase, so let your imagination guide your project choices.\nIn conclusion, engaging in projects is an invaluable part of your coding journey. It solidifies your learning, enhances your problem-solving skills, and helps bridge the gap between theory and practical application. Remember, it’s about the journey, not just the destination.\n\n\n\n\nEven as you progress and become more adept at your chosen programming language, it’s crucial to regularly revisit the basics. With the experience you’ve accumulated, your understanding of fundamental concepts will deepen, and you’ll often gain new insights. This revisiting is not only a refresher but also a means of reinforcing and solidifying your skills.\nIn my opinion, one of the most effective ways to strengthen your grasp of the basics is to teach or help others. Once you’ve completed your first project, you should be at a level where you can offer valuable advice to beginners. The power of teaching lies in transforming your practical, personal knowledge into accessible and comprehensible information for those who are just starting out. This process not only hones your pedagogical skills but also compels you to develop a clearer understanding of fundamental principles. You’ll frequently find yourself answering the daunting “Why?” question, which in turn deepens your own comprehension.\nAdditionally, teaching requires you to discern what is essential to convey, further clarifying your understanding of the basics. Engaging in online or in-person groups where you can teach or assist others is highly beneficial.

Her story is a testament to the power of following the principles we’ve discussed.\n\n\nSamira’s journey began with uncertainty. She knew she wanted to dive into deep learning, but the path was unclear. After scouring through various reputable sites like Coursera, edX, and freeCodeCamp, classical social medias (Reddit, Twitter and YouTube) and Python’s tutorials, she decided to focus on creating web applications using Python to implement machine learning models. This decision formed the basis and goal of her roadmap, a path she was eager to explore.\n\n\n\nWith her goal set, Samira outlined her roadmap. She started with the basics of Python, dedicating weeks to understanding its syntax and philosophy. She utilized free resources like Python’s official documentation and YouTube tutorials for visual learning. Her notes were meticulous, filled with insights and reflections, making them a personal encyclopedia of knowledge. Her roadmap:\n\n\n\nWeek 1-2:\n\nFocus on basic syntax, variable types, and basic operations in Python.\nResources: Python’s official documentation, beginner-friendly tutorials on YouTube.\nExercises: Simple programs like a calculator, basic data manipulation.\n\nWeek 3-4:\n\nIntroduction to more complex concepts such as control structures (if-else, loops), functions, and basic data structures (lists, dictionaries).\nBuilding small projects like a simple text-based game or a to-do list application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5-6:\n\nLearning about APIs and how to fetch data from the internet.\nProject: Building a weather application that fetches data from a weather API.\n\nWeek 7-8:\n\nIntroduction to web frameworks in Python (like Flask or Django).\nProject: Creating a basic web application that allows users to interact with it.\n\nWeek 9-10:\n\nDeepening knowledge of Python by exploring more advanced features.\nBeginning to learn about databases and how to integrate them into her projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11-12:\n\nBasic concepts of machine learning and data science.\nResources: Online courses on platforms like Coursera or edX, specialized in Python for data science.\n\nWeek 13-15:\n\nPractical application: Starting with simple machine learning models.\nProject: Building a simple prediction model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 16-18:\n\nIntroduction to R: Focused on data analysis and visualization.\nProject: Data analysis of a dataset using R.\n\nWeek 19-23:\n\nIntroduction to Julia: Focused on its application in machine learning.\nProject: Implementing a machine learning model in Julia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuously working on more complex machine learning and deep learning projects.\nCollaborating with others in the field, contributing to open source projects, and possibly teaching beginners.\n\nOf course her roadmap wasn’t like that at the beginning and she adapted it in the way. ### Engaging in projects\nSamira’s first project was a simple Python-based calculator. Guided tutorials helped her at this stage, but she quickly moved on to more complex projects, like a weather prediction app. This project required her to delve into APIs and learn data handling in Python, a challenging yet rewarding endeavor.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the importance of collaboration, Samira joined a local coding club. Here, she not only shared her knowledge but also gained insights from more experienced programmers. This exposure broadened her understanding and introduced her to new perspectives and coding practices.\n\n\n\nAs Samira’s confidence grew, so did her curiosity. She ventured into learning R and Julia, recognizing their specific strengths in data analysis and machine learning. This expanded skill set allowed her to approach problems more flexibly, choosing the right tool for each task (sometimes mixing the languages for powerful projects).\n\n\n\nThe journey wasn’t without its hurdles. Debugging her first machine learning model in Python was a particularly daunting task. The model’s performance was initially poor, leading her to revisit the basics and adjust her approach. It was a lesson in persistence and the value of continuous learning.\n\n\n\nBy applying the principles we’ve discussed, Samira transformed from a beginner to a proficient programmer, capable of handling complex deep learning tasks. Her story is a vivid illustration of how dedication, a well-structured approach, and the willingness to explore and collaborate can lead to remarkable growth in the world of programming.\nIn essence, Samira’s journey is a source of inspiration for anyone looking to start or enhance their journey in coding. It shows that with the right mindset and approach, the world of programming is not just accessible, but also a fertile ground for personal and professional growth.\n\n\n\nAs we wrap up this guide, let’s reflect on the key elements that make the journey of learning to code both achievable and fulfilling.\n\nMake a roadmap: Start with a clear plan.

    "text": "Note: If you exactly know what you want to learn you can skip this part!\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed about where to start your coding journey, you’re not alone. “What should I learn first?” is an increasingly common question, not just due to the vast array of options available, but also because of the ongoing ‘wars’ between different programming languages, each claiming to be the best. Navigating through these passionate and often subjective debates can be tricky. It can lead to two main issues: difficulty in making a choice (which breeds procrastination) or ending up with a language that doesn’t really suit your needs.\nTake, for instance, the classic debates like “The best programming language for…”, “Which JavaScript Framework to choose?”, or the famous “Python vs. R”. These discussions are recurrent and can be more confusing than helpful. So, how do you cut through the noise?\nThe simplest approach is to avoid starting your search on the Internet. Instead, make a list of your own needs and objectives. On the Internet, there’s a risk that others will decide for you, pitching a language as the be-all and end-all (though, thankfully, not everyone does this). Approaching with a clear idea of what you want to achieve helps limit undue influence and indecision.\nAlso, consider the support and resources available around you (friends, colleagues or books) and align them with your personal or professional plans. If you’re still in doubt, it’s okay to pick an option at random or go with a ‘default’ choice. Don’t linger too long in this phase of decision-making. Remember, you can always pivot to another language later – no learning is ever wasted.\nThe beauty of programming is that the core concepts are often transferable between languages. Different programming languages are just tools – it’s how you use them that matters. For example, if you start with Python due to its simplicity and later decide to switch to Java, you’ll find that many concepts like loops, variables, and data structures are similar, just with different syntax.\n\n\nIt’s a legitimate question - as a beginner, we don’t necessarily know how to translate our needs into clear, domain-specific objectives. Before going on the Internet, it’s always wiser to talk it over with a more advanced acquaintance. Now, in the age of artificial intelligence, an in-depth discussion with a model like ChatGPT can be enlightening (but becareful it might be biased!).\nIn summary, step zero is about making an informed, yet not overthought, decision. Choose a language or a technology based on your current needs, availability of resources, and your future goals. And remember, the journey of coding is flexible – it’s perfectly fine to change paths as you grow and discover more about your interests and the tech world."

    "text": "The journey of learning to code is akin to embarking on a voyage – having a roadmap is crucial. The path of least resistance often leads to joining online curricula or courses on platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/, Udemy, or freeCodeCamp. While these courses are beneficial and circumvent the need to design your own program, they are, by nature, very standardized. They may not align perfectly with your objectives or your preferred learning style.\nIf you find that these courses don’t meet your unique needs, crafting your own roadmap is a viable alternative. It’s tempting to dive straight into tutorials and start coding, but this approach can often lead to confusion and discouragement. The key is to have a clear goal. You should be able to answer questions like, “Why do I want to learn this programming language?” or “What do I specifically want to create with it?” Remember, a programming language can serve many purposes – from developing websites (like HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development) to creating data analysis tools (such as Python for data science).\nOnce you’ve defined your objective, the next step is to break it down into smaller, achievable, and measurable goals. For instance, if your aim is to build a website, start by learning basic HTML and CSS. Then, gradually progress to more complex tasks like JavaScript and back-end development.\nWith these smaller goals in mind, order them and compile them into a learning roadmap. The more personalized your roadmap, the better. However, it’s essential to start with the basics regardless of your ultimate goal. At this stage, your roadmap doesn’t have to be incredibly detailed, but you should at least know what skills you need to acquire at each stage.\nDon’t underestimate the importance of this planning phase. Dedicate a good amount of time to it – up to two weeks, if necessary. During this period, don’t hesitate to seek advice from more advanced individuals or even artificial intelligence platforms. Compare your plan with roadmaps recommended by others to ensure you’re on the right track.\nRemember, your roadmap is not set in stone. It should be a living document that evolves as you gain more knowledge and understanding of the subject. You can’t know everything from the outset, and it’s perfectly fine to adapt your plan as you progress. Especially when it comes to projects (see “6. Engage in projects”).\nIn conclusion, a well-thought-out roadmap tailored to your specific goals and learning style is an invaluable tool in your journey to learn coding. It provides direction, keeps you focused, and helps measure your progress, setting you up for a successful and fulfilling learning experience."

    "text": "Selecting the right resources is a crucial step in making your roadmap more tangible. It’s not necessary to have resources for every step right away; you can discover new resources as you progress. The key is not to get bogged down in finding the ‘best’ resources, as this can be a laborious and often futile task. Focus on finding resources that best suit your learning style.\nTo help you with this, ask yourself some guiding questions: - “Am I willing to spend money to learn?” - “Do I prefer paper or digital resources?” - “Do I prefer static or interactive resources?”\nFor each of these combinations, there are corresponding resource types: - If you’re open to spending money and prefer paper resources, consider investing in comprehensive coding books. - If you prefer digital and are willing to invest, paid online courses on platforms like Udemy or Pluralsight offer structured learning paths. - For those who prefer free resources, there’s a wealth of YouTube tutorials and online documentation. - If interactive learning is your style, platforms like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp offer hands-on coding exercises.\nFor more interactive learning ressources (exercices) I wrote a blog post here: “Free programming exercice website”.\nIt’s important to note that preferences might change based on your experience level. For example, if you’re learning your second programming language, you might find more advanced resources like technical blogs or community forums more beneficial.\nHowever, each type of resource has its shortcomings. Books can become outdated, online courses might not cover the latest technologies, and videos can sometimes lack depth. Don’t hesitate to ask for recommendations from experienced coders or online communities for a list of useful resources.\nA great way to start strong is by taking a crash course (written or video) of maximum 2 hours, and coding along with it. This approach helps you quickly grasp the syntax and philosophy of the language. Remember, it’s crucial to practice actively and not just passively follow along with the theory. For more advanced programmer with a good understanding of programming concepts reaching their new programming language a website like “learning x in y minutes” might be a good ressource.\nKeep in mind that there’s no such thing as a perfect resource. It’s okay to change your resources as you progress. The most important thing is to work hard and stick with it for as long as possible.\nNow that the beginning of your roadmap is set, you’re ready to embark on your coding journey with confidence. Remember, the journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single keystroke!"

    "text": "This section emphasizes a good practice crucial for avoiding stagnation and deviation in your coding journey: taking notes throughout the learning process. While some programming languages like Julia have exceptional documentation, others like Python boast a plethora of tutorials by individuals. Then there are languages with more challenging documentation, such as Haskell or Nim. But ultimately, the best documentation is the one you create for yourself.\nThis can take the form of personalized notes in a style that suits you best, be it a text document, a Word file, or a Markdown file. Another vital type of documentation is the code you write yourself. Ensure it’s clean and well-commented (but not excessively so). This code becomes a valuable resource when you need an example later. Additionally, organize your code and folders effectively to easily navigate your work.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to seeking help, autonomy should always be your first approach. This means trying to solve problems on your own by testing and researching, sometimes for hours, before seeking external assistance. Remember, making mistakes is a fundamental part of learning. Relying too heavily on others for answers – whether it’s a more experienced colleague or the internet – deprives you of the crucial problem-solving experience at the heart of programming.\nThe risk with relying on artificial intelligence for help is that it can provide answers without limit, which can lead to a dependency on external solutions. Without honing your problem-solving skills, your learning becomes slower and less effective, leaving you reliant on others or tools for coding. Strive for independence.\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to learn the best practices and tricks of the language you’re studying. The beauty of these tips is that they can be learned at different stages of your journey. However, the sooner you incorporate them, the more quickly you’ll boost your productivity. Embracing these best practices early on is always beneficial.\nIn summary, keep detailed notes, stay organized, seek autonomy in problem-solving, and continuously learn best practices and tricks in your chosen programming language. These steps are fundamental in developing a strong foundation in coding, leading you towards becoming a proficient and independent coder."

However, learning the basics isn’t just about grasping the syntax; it’s equally important to understand the philosophy behind the language. The best way to solidify your understanding of these basics is through practice exercises, underscoring the importance of choosing the right resources.\n\n\nThere are several universal concepts common to all programming languages that you need to ensure you master:\n\nVariable declaration: Understanding how to create and use variables.\nData types: Familiarity with different types of data (e.g., integers, strings).\nControl structures: Knowledge of if-else statements, loops, etc.\nFunctions/methods: Creating and utilizing reusable blocks of code.\nInput/output operations: Handling user input and system output.\nError handling: Managing and responding to errors in code.\nBasic data structures: Using arrays, lists, and dictionaries.\n\nAs data scientists or statisticians, we have the impression that these concepts are not important to us as long as we don’t code as a programmer (we can use R without knowing how to program, for example), but this deprives us of essential knowledge that will help us in our learning process (in particular, understanding and resolving errors).\n\n\n\n\nTake your time and don’t rush the learning process.\nPractice as much as possible with small coding exercises.\nUse your notes as a reference and keep updating them.\nDon’t be too hard on yourself.\nDon’t try to understand everything perfectly, you will come back to it latter if needed.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an estimated learning time for various programming languages (non-exhaustive list), ordered from easiest to most difficult:\n\n\n\nProgramming language\nLevel of difficulty\nEstimated learning time\n\n\n\n\nLua\nEasy\n2-3 weeks\n\n\nPython\nEasy\n3-4 weeks\n\n\nR\nEasy-Moderate\n4-5 weeks\n\n\nJulia\nModerate\n5-6 weeks\n\n\nJavaScript\nModerate\n5-6 weeks\n\n\nGo\nModerate-Hard\n6-8 weeks\n\n\nJava\nModerate-Hard\n6-8 weeks\n\n\nRust\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\nNim\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\nC/C++\nHard\n8-10 weeks\n\n\n\nRemember, it’s okay not to master everything at first. Your understanding will deepen as you work on projects and revisit the basics later. The most important thing is to take comprehensive notes during your learning process. You will come back to it latter!\nIn conclusion, give yourself time to thoroughly learn and understand the basics of your chosen programming language. This solid foundation will set you up for success as you progress in your coding journey.\nWarning: You don’t want to go too fast, but you don’t want to take too long either.

The interfaces to this package are all simple functions using standard types. The complexity of large language models is hidden from view while providing free local inference using light-weight, open models. All included models are free for educational use, no API keys are required, and all inference is performed locally by default.\nRead more about it\n\nimport languagemodels as lm\n\n\nlm.do(\"What color is the sky?\")\n\n'The color of the sky is blue.'\n\n\nFetching 6 files:   0%|          | 0/6 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\nFetching 6 files: 100%|##########| 6/6 [00:00&lt;00:00, 5375.02it/s]\n\n\n\nTo easy, let’s try something a bit harder\n\nlm.do(\"If I have 7 apples then eat 5, how many apples do I have?\")\n\n'You have 8 apples.'\n\n\nAouch…\nIndeed the model performance is quite low because the models used by this package are 1000x smaller than the largest models in use today. They are useful as learning tools, but if you are expecting ChatGPT or similar performance, you will be very disappointed…\nThe base model should work on any system with 512MB of memory, but this memory limit can be increased. Setting this value higher will require more memory and generate results more slowly, but the results should be superior.\n\n#lm.set_max_ram('4gb')\n\n\nlm.do(\"If I have 7 apples then eat 5, how many apples do I have?\")\n\n'You have 8 apples.'\n\n\nYeah, here we go little (4gb) buddy!\n\nNow that we got the basics, let’s play with it! You can change the prompt like such\n\nlm.chat('''\n     System: Respond as a physics professor.\n\n     User: What is relativity?\n\n     Assistant:\n     ''')\n\n'Relativity is the theory of relativity that describes how space, time, and gravity interact with each other.

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\\n\\nAdvances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.'"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the exciting world of polyglot programming! As a programmer, the ability to speak multiple programming languages fluently is akin to a craftsman possessing a diverse set of tools. Each language is a unique tool, designed to handle specific tasks efficiently and effectively. By being a polyglot programmer, you equip yourself with a versatile arsenal, ensuring that you always have the best tool for any job.\nEmbarking on the journey to learn multiple programming languages is a rewarding endeavor, albeit not without its challenges. The initial steps into programming can be daunting, and the learning curve for the second language often feels steeper. However, once you overcome these early hurdles, acquiring new languages becomes progressively easier and more intuitive.\nThe goal isn’t to achieve mastery in every language (we generally have one or two “mains”). Rather, it’s about reaching a level of comfort that allows you to switch between languages with ease, depending on the task at hand. It’s perfectly acceptable, and sometimes even preferable, to learn certain languages for specific use cases. For example, no one expects a web developer to build a website using Prolog. It’s all about using the right tool for the right job.\nAs we dive into the world of polyglot programming, remember: the journey is as rewarding as the destination. Let’s explore how being a polyglot opens up a universe of possibilities and makes you a more effective, versatile programmer.\n\n\n\n\nThe advantages of being a polyglot in an era of interoperability and microservices: Mastery of multiple languages enables seamless navigation and integration in microservices-based architectures.\nExample for data sciencetist: Discover how being a polyglot programmer elevates your data science capabilities, allowing you to choose the most efficient tools for data analysis, machine learning, and more.\nMy programming languages and why I use them: A personal journey through the languages I use, revealing the unique strengths and applications of each.\n\nR - The statistician’s power tool: Learn how R excels in statistical analysis, machine learning, and dashboarding, despite its slower speed.\nPython - The versatile giant: Delve into Python’s world, a beginner-friendly language known for its extensive libraries and role as the lingua franca of programming.\nJulia - The high-speed performer: Explore the world of Julia, a language that combines phenomenal speed with a focus on numerical computation, making it ideal for high-performance tasks.\nNim - The rising star: Discover Nim, a language that balances speed with easy syntax, perfect for scripting, desktop, and web app development.\nJavaScript - The web’s artist: Uncover the capabilities of JavaScript in web development and programming art, a language known for its powerful visualization tools.\n\nConclusion: Embracing diversity in programming languages\nBonus: The quirky side of my programming languages\n\nR: The ponderous professor\nPython: The popular kid with too many friends\nJulia: The speedy brainiac with a memory problem\nNim: The secret agent with few contacts\nJavaScript: The artist with a messy palette\n\n\nJoin me on this enlightening journey to explore the multifaceted world of polyglot programming. Let’s embark on this adventure together, learning, growing, and discovering the best programming tools for every challenge we might face!\n\n\n\nIn today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, where interoperability among programming languages and the adoption of microservices architecture are becoming the norm, being a polyglot programmer is more advantageous than ever. This trend towards a more interconnected and modular approach in software development highlights the immense value of versatility in programming skills.\nThe ability to fluently use multiple languages allows you to weave through different ecosystems with ease. It’s like being a skilled diplomat who can navigate diverse cultures effortlessly. In a world where applications are increasingly built using microservices – each potentially written in a different language – the polyglot programmer stands out as a versatile and invaluable asset. They can understand, connect, and integrate various services, regardless of the language in which they’re written.\nMoreover, with languages becoming more interoperable, the lines between them are blurring. Libraries and frameworks are often available across multiple languages, and being knowledgeable in several of them enables you to choose the most effective tool for each specific task. This flexibility not only enhances the quality and efficiency of your work but also broadens your perspective, allowing you to approach problems with a more holistic and creative mindset.\nIn essence, being a polyglot in this era of interoperability and microservices is like having a master key to the vast and intricate world of programming. It empowers you to build more robust, scalable, and innovative applications, making you an invaluable resource in any development team.\n\n\n\nIn the realm of data science, Python often shines as the star, casting a long shadow with its popularity and widespread industry use. However, hidden in this shadow are gems often overlooked - R and Julia. These languages are not just alternatives; they are powerful tools in their own right, each with unique strengths and capabilities.\nFor years, the debate of “Python or R for Data Science?” has echoed in the halls of academia and industry. This question, however, harbors a misleading assumption – that one must choose a single language to commit to for life. It’s like saying you should only ever use a hammer for all your construction needs, ignoring the precision of a screwdriver or the strength of a wrench.\nThe Python advocates have done a stellar job, leading many to choose Python, especially since it’s more prevalent in the industry. But this approach can be limiting. Why confine ourselves to the most popular or the ‘chosen one’ when the landscape of programming is so rich and diverse?\nI once fell into the “Just use Python” trap. It was an excellent place to start, but as I delved deeper into data science, I realized the limitations of sticking to one language. My journey led me to R, a language that excels in statistical analysis and advanced data manipulation.

    "text": "In the realm of data science, Python often shines as the star, casting a long shadow with its popularity and widespread industry use. However, hidden in this shadow are gems often overlooked - R and Julia. These languages are not just alternatives; they are powerful tools in their own right, each with unique strengths and capabilities.\nFor years, the debate of “Python or R for Data Science?” has echoed in the halls of academia and industry. This question, however, harbors a misleading assumption – that one must choose a single language to commit to for life. It’s like saying you should only ever use a hammer for all your construction needs, ignoring the precision of a screwdriver or the strength of a wrench.\nThe Python advocates have done a stellar job, leading many to choose Python, especially since it’s more prevalent in the industry. But this approach can be limiting. Why confine ourselves to the most popular or the ‘chosen one’ when the landscape of programming is so rich and diverse?\nI once fell into the “Just use Python” trap. It was an excellent place to start, but as I delved deeper into data science, I realized the limitations of sticking to one language. My journey led me to R, a language that excels in statistical analysis and advanced data manipulation. It opened my eyes to new methodologies, better suited for certain types of data challenges.\nThen came Julia, a language that blends the ease of Python with the speed of C.

    "text": "Bonus: The quirky side of my programming languages\nAh, the beloved languages of my programming life – each one a unique character in the grand narrative of coding. But, let’s be honest, they each come with their own set of quirks and idiosyncrasies. Here’s a lighthearted look at the problems with my chosen languages, because after all, nothing and no one is perfect!\n\nR: The ponderous professor\nR, oh R, you’re like that brilliant professor who knows everything about statistics but takes an eternity to get to the point. Your performance can be slower than a snail racing uphill. And your love for numerical computation is so exclusive, it’s as if you’re saying, “Characters? What are those?”. Also, it would be good if you could more often go out of your University and go in production. Life is not only about statistic you know?\n\n\nPython: The popular kid with too many friends\nPython, you’re slow! You’re the cool kid on the block, loved by all, but sometimes you spread yourself too thin. You try to be everything for everyone, and it can lead to a lack of coherence. Plus, your popularity contest sometimes overshadows other equally deserving languages (Yes you’re overrated, sorry!). And let’s be honest, without C/C++ giving you your pocket money, where would you be? Maybe the shadow of Lua? Would you have as much friends? Oh, Did I mention you’re slow?\n\n\nJulia: The speedy brainiac with a memory problem\nJulia, you’re lightning-fast, but your memory usage is like someone who shops too much on a sale day - you just can’t help grabbing everything! And let’s not get started on your slow compilation time. It’s like waiting for a gourmet meal; great once it’s there, but oh, the wait! Please, let’s not talk about your executables, I don’t want to ruin my mood.\n\n\nNim: The secret agent with few contacts\nNim, you’re fast and efficient, like a secret agent, but you’re a bit of a loner. Seriously no one know you, you are invisible! Julia is younger than you and focus in a small community and is still more popular than you, how? Your small community and the lack of comprehensive documentation can make you feel like you’re part of an exclusive club that’s hard for newcomers to join. Having said that, I’m making the assumption that you really want to be discovered, but that remains to be seen…\n\n\nJavaScript: The artist with a messy palette\nJavaScript, the artist of the web, your creativity knows no bounds. But sometimes, your syntax is as unpredictable as a toddler’s mood swings. And the amount of boilerplate code you require – it’s like asking for a five-course meal when all I want is a sandwich!\n\n\nEmbracing bias with a pinch of salt\nNow, I must sheepishly admit, like many programmers, I harbor biases towards my chosen languages. It’s natural; we’re human, not machines. Our backgrounds, experiences, and preferences shape our choices. But the key is to be aware of these biases, not to be absolutist about our choices, and to always remain open to learning.\nEvery programming language has its flaws, and it’s important to recognize them humorously and with a grain of salt. What’s essential is understanding that these ‘flaws’ are often what make a language uniquely suited for certain tasks. It’s not about finding the perfect language; it’s about finding the right language for the right job, warts and all.\nIn the end, every programming language is ‘bad’ in its own unique and useful way. They’re like friends with different personalities; some are reliable, some are flashy, some are deep thinkers, and others are social butterflies. But together, they make for a diverse and capable team. So, let’s continue to embrace the quirky world of programming languages, with all its imperfections and charm!"

The plot will open in a browser window and it’s fairly snappy. The good think is that on the reticulate side, knitting works! So this side was able to put all this together via rmarkdown when I started this post and Quarto now that I’m finishing this post (remember any  chunk will default to the knitr engine), so that’s pretty cool. We’re even using both renv and venv for both environments in the same file \n\n\n\n + plotly\n\ndef plotly_title(title, subtitle):\n  return(f\"&lt;b&gt;{title}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{subtitle}&lt;/sup&gt;\")\n\nmargin = dict(\n  t = 95,\n  r = 40,\n  b = 120,\n  l = 79)\n  \nconfig = {\"displayModeBar\": False}\n\n(px.scatter(\n  (gapminder.filter(pl.col(\"year\") == 1962).to_pandas()),\n  x = \"fertility\", y = \"life_expectancy\", color = \"continent\",\n  hover_name = \"country\",\n  color_discrete_sequence = px.colors.qualitative.Set2,\n  title = plotly_title(\n    title = \"Scatterplot\", \n    subtitle = \"Life expectancy by fertility\"),\n  opacity = .8, \n  template = \"plotly_white\") \n  .update_traces(\n    marker = dict(\n      size = 7))\n  .update_layout(\n    margin = margin)\n).show(config = config) \n\n\n                        \n                                            \n\n\n\nplotly expects a pandas DataFrame so we’re just using .to_pandas() to give it what it wants, but that doesn’t have to stop you from adding any filtering, summarizing, or aggregating before chaining the data into your viz."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Contribution\n\n\n\nHow to Contribute to Our website with Blog Posts Using R and RStudio\nHello, esteemed statisticians and fellows of WeData!\nI appreciate your dedication and knowledge, and now I offer an opportunity for you to share your wisdom with the world! If you’re comfortable using R and RStudio, I believe that the process will be smooth, faster, and easier. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to our group via blog posts. Let’s start this journey together!\n\nPrerequisites:\nBefore I delve into the details, there are a couple of things you need:\n\nGitHub Account: If you don’t have one yet, simply visit GitHub and register an account. Once you’ve done that, share your GitHub username with us, and I will add you to our group account. Not familiar with GitHub? No worries! Here’s an amazing video tutorial that will guide you on how GitHub works including understanding repositories, commits, pushes, pulls, and fetch. It will also show you how to use GitHub Desktop if you are allergic to terminals,\n\n\n\nStep-by-step Guide:\nNow, let’s move onto the core part:\n\nStep 1: Clone the Repository\nOn your local machine, clone the repository we-data-ch/blog in the place you want. To do so, open your terminal and type:\ngit clone https://github.com/usour/glave.git\nAgain, if you are allergic to terminals you can clone the repository using GitHub Desktop\nThis will create a copy of our repository on your machine.\n\n\nStep 2: Open the Repository in RStudio\nI recommend you to open the cloned repository in RStudio as a project. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory, and then navigate to the blog folder. This will set up your environment and make the workflow smoother.\n\n\nStep 3: Install the blogdown Package\nIn case you have not installed it yet, use the following command to install the blogdown package:\ninstall.packages(\"blogdown\")\nOnce it is installed, you need to restart R to make sure everything is properly loaded.\n\n\nStep 4: Start a New Article\nNow you’re ready to write your own article! To create a new post, simply run (Note: here there are 3 : so :::):\nblogdown:::new_post_addin()\nThis will open a dialogue where you can fill in details about your post like its title, author name, date, and more. If you don’t know what a field means, just let it blank, you can always change it later in the YAML (header of the file, meaning the first part). You can either chose Rmarkdown or markdown (if you don’t want to add code). You don’t know R/markdown? here is an introduction video. If you don’t want to learn markdown (which is to bad because it is very easy), you can still use a trick (see in the step 5 “Visual” subsection)!\n\n\nStep 5: Edit the Document\nAfter the creation of the post, the corresponding file will open in the source editor. This is where your magic happens! Begin writing your blog post. Remember, our website supports markdown syntax, so you can easily format your text with headings, lists, links, etc.\n\nThe YAML\nAt the top of your document you have the YAML which is the header in which you can manage the meta information about your blog post. It looks like that:\n\n\n\nIn example the one I used for this post\n\n\nLet’s break it down!\nNote: you don’t need to use quotation marks!\n\ntitle: This field is used for the title of the post or webpage. It’s typically displayed at the top of the page and used in the browser’s title bar.\nauthor: This field specifies the author of the post or webpage.\ndate: This specifies the date the post was written or the webpage was last updated. It’s usually displayed somewhere near the top of the page.\nslug: This is used as the tail-end of the URL for the specific post or webpage. For instance, if your slug is “my-awesome-post”, the URL might be “www.yoursite.com/my-awesome-post”.\ncategories: This is a list of categories that the post or webpage belongs to. Categories are a higher-level way to organize posts/webpages, and they can typically contain multiple tags.\ntags: This is a list of tags associated with the post or webpage. Tags are generally more specific than categories and are useful for users searching for a specific topic.\ndescription: This field is used for a brief description or summary of the post or webpage. It’s often used in the webpage’s metadata and can be used by search engines.\nimage: This specifies a path or URL to an image file associated with the post or webpage. This image might be used as a thumbnail or a header image. The easiest way to enter the path of a local image is to move the image into the same folder as the post, so that all you have to enter is the image name (with its extension).\nmath: This field, if set to “yes”, indicates that the post or webpage contains mathematical notations or formulae that need to be rendered properly.\nlicense: This specifies the license under which the content of the post or webpage is shared.\nhidden: If this is set to “yes”, the post or webpage won’t be listed in the index or feed of the site but can still be accessed directly via its URL.\ncomments: If this is set to “yes”, it allows users to comment on the post or webpage.\n\nYou don’t need to fill everything, but you should add the title, the date and the author of the blog post.\n\n\nVisual\nIf you don’t want to use markdown to edit your document, simply use the visual mode in RStudio that allow you to edit markdown and Rmarkdown file as if they were word documents. To do this, click on the “Visual” button at the top left of the code window, as shown in the following image:\n\n\n\nvisual mode\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Preview Your Post\nTo check how your blog post looks like in real-time, use:\nblogdown::serve_site()\nThis will start a local server and open a preview of the entire blog in the viewer pane on RStudio. You can easily access your own post from there. To stop the server, just run:\nblogdown::stop_server()\nblogdown::serve_site() has the advantage of being dynamic in the sense that when it is activated, you can modify your blog post on RStudio and see the changes take place automatically on the screen. You could also use it from the start (before running any code).\nPlease note, however, that the server will not launch if there is an error in your code.\n\n\nStep 7: Commit and Push to the Repository\nOnce you’re satisfied with your article, it is time to share it with the world! First, you need to save your changes. In the RStudio Git pane, stage your changes, then commit with a meaningful message or you can also do the same on GitHub desktop.\nNext, push your changes:\ngit push\nAgain if you are allergic to terminals here is how you can do it with GitHub Desktop\nAnd voilà! You’ve just contributed to our website. Congratulations!\nThis might seem like a lot at first, but once you get the hang of it, the process becomes second nature. I look forward to your valuable contributions. Happy blogging!"
