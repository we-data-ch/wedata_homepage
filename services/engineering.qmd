## {{< fa laptop-code >}}  Software Development & Engineering

<br> Prototypes to production systems that serve users and teams reliably.

Overview: We design and implement software—from early prototypes to hardened services—balancing rapid delivery with engineering discipline.

We can help you with:

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **R packages & Shiny applications** — Reusable code, tests and production‑grade analytics UIs.
