## {{< fa flask >}}  Research & Analytics Consulting

<br> From research question to deployable, auditable results.

Overview: We partner on applied research and analytics mandates with an emphasis on reproducibility, uncertainty quantification and operationalisation.

We can help you with:

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Demography (description · prediction · simulation)** — Population models and scenario analysis for planning and policy.
