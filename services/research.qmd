## {{< fa flask >}}  Research & Analytics Consulting

<br> From research question to deployable, auditable results.

Overview: We partner on applied research and analytics mandates with an emphasis on reproducibility, uncertainty quantification and operationalisation.

We can help you with:

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Demography (description · prediction · simulation)** — Population models and scenario analysis for planning and policy.

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Public policy analysis** — Evidence synthesis and impact assessments that inform decisions.  
	![Policy analysis](https://picsum.photos/seed/policy/400/250){width="400" height="250"}

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Social network analysis** — Network construction, community detection and interpretation.  
	![Networks](https://picsum.photos/seed/networks/400/250){width="400" height="250"}

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Bayesian modelling & statistical inference** — Transparent probabilistic models and clear uncertainty communication.  
	![Bayesian modelling](https://picsum.photos/seed/bayesian/400/250){width="400" height="250"}

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Reproducible analysis pipelines** — End‑to‑end workflows from raw data to report with versioning and provenance.  
	![Pipelines](https://picsum.photos/seed/pipelines/400/250){width="400" height="250"}

-   {{< fa angle-double-right >}} **Fraud, risk, behaviour, demand and operations modelling** — Predictive and diagnostic models tuned to operational constraints.
